New York Board of Elections Cancels Democratic Presidential Primary,"New York officials canceled the state’s Democratic presidential primary on Monday, calling the vote a “beauty contest” that the state could ill afford in the face of the coronavirus epidemic. The move by Democrats on the New York State Board of Elections followed the decision by Senator Bernie Sanders to concede the Democratic presidential nomination to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., rendering the primary unnecessary. Officials had struggled with the decision, which was certain to anger some supporters of Mr. Sanders, but they ultimately concluded that the risk of spreading the coronavirus was too great to justify holding an election with no real meaning. Because of the board’s decision, voters in about 20 counties that had no other contests on their ballot will have no need to go to the polls on June 23.  Supporters of Mr. Sanders had mounted an email and phone campaign to pressure the two Democratic members of the Board of Elections to keep Mr. Sanders on the ballot and hold a presidential primary, allowing Sanders backers to amass delegates to the Democratic National Convention, where they could wield influence over the party platform. The board’s Democratic co-chairman, Douglas A. Kellner, said he had read thousands of emails from Sanders supporters urging the board to go forward before making his decision to vote against holding the primary, but ultimately decided that it was time to acknowledge that the primary served no significant purpose. “What the Sanders campaign wanted is essentially a beauty contest that, given the situation with the public health emergency, seems to be unnecessary and, indeed, frivolous,” Mr. Kellner said. In a letter to the board on Sunday, Mr. Sanders’s campaign had urged the board to keep him on the ballot and hold a primary in the interest of party unity, and the Sanders-aligned group Our Revolution had cautioned against the presidential primary’s cancellation. “Suppressing the Sanders vote in New York will again lead to attacks on the Party across the nation and harm the volunteer effort that our group and others are building for Joe Biden,” the group’s chair, Larry Cohen, said before the vote, suggesting he would challenge the New York delegation on the floor of the convention. With the decision, made during a telephone meeting by the two Democrats on the election board, New York became the first state to cancel its presidential primary, only the latest major development in the shifting national electoral landscape. In response to the coronavirus epidemic, 16 states have postponed their primaries and many have taken measures to encourage voting by mail. Despite arrangements to encourage absentee voting, polling places are expected to remain open in about 42 counties for down-ballot races. Andrew J. Spano, the other board member who voted in the unanimous decision, said the chance a primary could spread the coronavirus to both the public and poll workers counterbalanced the wishes of Mr. Sanders’s supporters. Mr. Spano, a former Westchester County executive, said he had only reached a conclusion on how to vote on Monday morning, following what he described as a roller coaster weekend, but ultimately concluded, “We should minimize the risk.” Asked about the decision at his daily coronavirus briefing in Albany, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said he would not “second guess” the board. “I know there are a lot of election employees, employees of boards of elections, who are nervous about conducting elections. But I’ll leave it up to the Board of Elections,” Mr. Cuomo said. Mr. Kellner said the decision was in keeping with a New York law adopted on April 3 providing that candidates should be removed from ballots if they suspend or terminate their campaigns. “Obviously the intent of the legislature was not to have a primary election where there is no real contest,” said Mr. Kellner, a Manhattan lawyer who voted in favor of scrapping the primary. Elections officials had said it cost more than $300,000 for a medium-sized county to hold a primary — an amount that does not include sending pre-stamped absentee ballot applications to voters — estimating that the cost savings of not holding a primary would range in the millions of dollars. The chairman of the state Democratic Party, Jay Jacobs, had supported the move, saying that he had actively pushed to cancel the presidential primary in the state while still holding the congressional, State Senate, assembly and other local races. “The more we can do to reduce the risk factor of running the primary, the smarter I think that it is,” said Mr. Jacobs. Mr. Sanders’s campaign argued that the law permitting the Board of Elections to determine who had withdrawn from a campaign should not apply to him because it was too new. “Senator Sanders wishes to remain on the ballot, and is concerned that his removal from the ballot would undermine efforts to unify the Democratic Party in advance of the general election,” said the letter, written by Malcolm Seymour, a lawyer for the Sanders campaign. Mr. Sanders had said he was suspending his campaign on April 8, and he subsequently endorsed Mr. Biden. In doing so, however, he expressed a desire to remain on ballots and collect delegates in an effort to leverage his influence to push the party platform to better reflect his progressive positions. The Republican presidential primary in New York had already been called off in February when no other candidates beside President Trump qualified for the ballot. Officials in Connecticut had also pushed for calling off that state’s primary, which has been rescheduled to Aug. 11. Consequences for canceling the Democratic presidential primary in New York, however, are uncertain at the moment. Mr. Jacobs said he was not sure what it would mean for the state’s delegate count at the convention; that decision would be left to the Democratic National Committee’s rules committee. “The D.N.C. has been very clear: the D.N.C. does not want to do anything that looks like we’re being unfair,” said Mr. Jacobs. “And we’re not being unfair, we’re just reacting to a global pandemic which happens to be centered in New York at the time.” He added: “In a situation like this, lives have to trump politics, no pun intended.”Sydney Ember and Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting."
Nancy Pelosi Endorses Joe Biden,"Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Monday as the Democratic Party continued to coalesce around its presumptive presidential nominee. Mr. Biden now has the formal support of the party’s last president, Barack Obama; two of its most prominent progressives, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren; two previous presidential nominees, John Kerry and Al Gore; and its leader in the House, Ms. Pelosi. Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a prominent surrogate for Mr. Sanders, also endorsed Mr. Biden on Monday. In a video released on Monday morning, Ms. Pelosi drew on her years of working with Mr. Biden behind the scenes on legislation when he was Mr. Obama’s vice president, describing Mr. Biden as “a leader with the humility to seek expertise and science, and the confidence to act upon it.” “When our nation faced the Great Recession, it was Joe Biden who led the implementation — and the accountability — of the Recovery Act, helping create and save millions of jobs. When the Democratic Congress was passing the Affordable Care Act, Joe Biden was a partner for progress in the White House and also championed the cancer moonshot,” she said. Ms. Pelosi’s chief focus in the 2020 campaign has been on keeping the House in Democratic hands and helping her members, particularly vulnerable freshman, win re-election in November. While the primary was still competitive, she had remained carefully neutral, preserving her ability to try to distance her caucus from the eventual nominee if she thought it necessary. But she also had words of praise for Mr. Biden, saying “I’m not counting Joe Biden out” after his early losses in Iowa and New Hampshire. As many of her rank-and-file members fretted in February about the down-ballot implications of nominating Mr. Sanders, then the front-runner, Ms. Pelosi said she believed Democrats would “wholeheartedly support” whomever the party nominated. At the same time, she was laying the groundwork to distinguish House Democrats from Mr. Sanders if he won the nomination, unveiling a sweeping alternative to “Medicare for all” and telling reporters, “It is not unusual for a party platform or the candidates for president to have their own agenda that they would put forth, and it’s not unusual for the House of Representatives to have its agenda as well.” The path to victory for Democrats, she said in February, was with “a message of a bold progressive agenda that is mainstream and non-menacing.” That is roughly how Mr. Biden has been trying to present his agenda."
On Politics: Rattling Money Out of Congress’s Piggy Bank,"Good morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday. Where things standStates across the country are confronting enormous shortfalls as the coronavirus’s impact continues to deepen. The bipartisan National Governors Association has requested half a trillion dollars from the federal government to help states deal with lost tax revenue. But the latest coronavirus relief bill that President Trump signed on Friday didn’t include any money for state or local governments. Instead, Democrats have their sights set on passing major legislation soon that will help states shore up their finances. “We will have state and local, and we will have it in a very significant way,” Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Sunday. “We are including not only the outlays that they have for the coronavirus, but also the loss of revenue that they have.”But that will mean overcoming opposition from the Senate’s Republican leadership. Even before Trump had signed last week’s bill, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, suggested that governors should consider filing for bankruptcy — a move that could lead states to cancel public workers’ pensions and cut a range of social programs. That idea has been met with cries of indignation from governors across the country. In New York, Andrew Cuomo called it “really one of the dumb ideas of all time.” The Republican governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, also weighed in: “The last thing we need in the middle of an economic crisis is to have states all filing bankruptcy all across America and not able to provide services to people who desperately need them.” And on Sunday, Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, concurred. “For Senator McConnell to suggest that is incredibly dangerous, and I don’t think that the vast majority of governors in this country, Republican and Democratic, would agree with him,” she said.An exhaustive review by Times journalists of the president’s public statements since March 9 found that his most-used rhetorical device throughout the crisis has been that of self-congratulation. Analyzing more than 260,000 words spoken by Trump at White House briefings and in other remarks, our reporters found roughly 600 examples of self-praise, often built on exaggerations and untruths. That’s about 10 times as much as he has displayed empathy.Trump took a break from the briefings over the weekend after receiving a tidal wave of blowback last week, when he suggested injections of chemical disinfectants and sunlight as potential virus treatments. That led senior health officials — and even the heads of some cleaning-product companies — to issue statements clarifying that, as always, it was not a good idea to ingest bleach, Lysol and other disinfectants. (Trump later said he had meant this sarcastically, although nothing in his original statement suggested this.) This only added to murmurs of concern from top Republicans, many of whom had already fretted that the president could be hurting his own cause with the news conferences. This was the first time since Easter weekend two weeks ago — when the inconsistency and combativeness of his statements drew a similar chorus of concern from allies as well as enemies — that Trump had skipped his daily briefings. He hasn’t indicated yet whether he will be back at the lectern this evening. Photo of the day President Trump after signing the latest coronavirus relief package in the Oval Office on Friday. The need at food banks has skyrocketed. But some farmers still don’t know what to do with excess produce.Even as eateries across the country have closed or switched to takeout-only because of the pandemic, food banks have reported a huge surge in demand — causing many of them to experience hourslong lines and fears of potential shortages. But that’s not because of a lack of food available. Tens of millions of pounds of produce are withering on the vine — quite literally — in American fields. In mid-April, Dairy Farmers of America estimated that farms were dumping as many as 3.7 million gallons of milk each day. But for weeks, as the public need escalated at the peak of produce season, the Department of Agriculture ignored calls to help connect farmers with federal food-distribution programs so that surplus fruit, vegetables, dairy and meat wouldn’t go to waste, according to a report published Sunday in Politico. Almost a month ago, Florida’s commissioner of agriculture and members of the state’s congressional delegation asked Sonny Perdue, the federal agriculture secretary, to take steps to prevent food from going to waste. It wasn’t until mid-April that his department put forward a $19 billion aid program, including $3 billion to buy excess food, and over the weekend Politico found that there was still no indication that the government had stepped up its food purchases. “It’s not a lack of food, it’s that the food is in one place and the demand is somewhere else and they haven’t been able to connect the dots,” Tom Vilsack, the former secretary of agriculture in Barack Obama’s administration, told Politico. As part of the recently announced aid program, the Department of Agriculture has committed to buying $100 million in produce, meat and dairy products each month through the end of the current fiscal year.

A Survey of Essential Workers Shows a Political Divide,"Democrats and Republicans differ on attitudes toward coronavirus risks and in workplace behaviors meant to reduce them, according to a new survey. This partisanship has the potential to hurt efforts to stop the spread of the virus. The data from Gallup’s Covid-19 tracking panel shows that people deemed essential workers are generating large numbers of close contacts with other people, putting themselves and those they live with at risk. Recognizing this, most workers have changed how they do their jobs to reduce the risk of viral transmission. Yet workers living in counties won by President Trump in the 2016 election are slightly less likely to have adopted these changes, with Republicans living in those counties even less likely to have done so. Over several weeks in April, the survey shows, essential workers generated 22 contacts per day compared with only four per day for nonessential workers. (Contacts were defined as the number of people a respondent came within six feet of.) As expected, the workplace accounted for more of the essential workers’ contacts than any other location. But the workplace was the site of hardly any contacts for nonessential workers, most of whom are working from home, if at all. Over all, essential workers are not taking the risks of transmission lightly. The majority (55 percent) say they are moderately or very concerned about being exposed to the virus at work. Eighty percent of essential workers say they have changed how they do their work to lower the risk of transmission — and those who say they have made such changes generate fewer close contacts than those who haven’t. These efforts include trying to maintain at least six feet of distance from customers and co-workers, using masks and gloves, and adopting new and more frequent cleaning practices. Yet these attitudes also vary by political geography. Essential workers who identify with the Democratic Party are more likely to be concerned about getting the virus (66 percent) than their Republican Party counterparts (45 percent). They also have far greater confidence in social distancing. Three out of four (73 percent) essential workers who affiliate with the Democratic Party say that they are very confident that social distancing saves lives, compared with 27 percent of essential workers who identify as Republicans. For members of both parties, living in a county won by the president substantially reduces confidence in social distancing. Democrats living in counties won by Mr. Trump are 15 percentage points less likely to say they are very confident that social distancing saves lives compared with Democrats living in counties won by Hillary Clinton. These partisan differences are predictive of actual worker behavior, although with a more modest effect. Republican workers in Trump counties are less likely than their Republican counterparts in Clinton-won counties to say they have made changes to avoid transmission (74 percent versus 82 percent), and both groups are less likely to say they have made changes than Democrats in Trump-won counties (85 percent) or Clinton-won counties (89 percent). The use of personal protective equipment at work fits the same pattern. The pattern doesn’t always hold perfectly. Most Republican workers in Trump-won counties report trying to maintain at least six feet of distance from customers and co-workers (55 percent). That’s higher than the rate for Republicans in Clinton-won counties (47 percent), but it’s still well below Democrats in Clinton-won counties (70 percent). One potential explanation for the partisan patterns is that some Republican Party leaders or media pundits are playing down the severity of the risks. Another is that population density and the number of confirmed cases and deaths are lower on a per-capita basis in the counties won by Mr. Trump. But in the data, there is no significant correlation between county disease prevalence and adoption of these countermeasures. Moreover, while cases and deaths have been lower in Trump-won counties, the growth rate in new cases since April 11 is roughly the same in Trump-won and Clinton-won counties, suggesting that the need to reduce transmission could be just as urgent in these areas. As debates go on about when and how to reopen the economy, essential workers and their employers are developing best practices to combat the spread of coronavirus. But it will be hard to do so without cooperation and collective action across diverse communities. Because the virus knows no borders, outbreaks in liberal areas will put conservative areas at risk and vice versa.

Michigan Senator Apologizes for Mask That Looked Like Confederate Flag,"A Republican state senator in Michigan apologized for wearing a homemade mask that resembled the Confederate battle flag on the Senate floor on Friday. “I’m sorry for my choice of pattern on the face mask I wore yesterday,” the senator, Dale Zorn, said in a statement released on Saturday, adding that he did not intend to offend anyone. “However, I realize that I did, and for that I am sorry,” he said. “My actions were an error in judgment for which there are no excuses and I will learn from this episode.” The senator said he told his wife, who made the mask, that it “probably will raise some eyebrows,” but he initially told WLNS-TV on Friday that it was not a Confederate flag. He said his wife told him that the mask’s pattern was “more similar to” the state flags of Kentucky or Tennessee. The mask he wore, however, appeared to have more in common with the Confederate battle flag, which is all red and features a blue “X” with white stars inside it drawn across the flag. Kentucky’s state flag is royal blue with the state seal in the center and “Commonwealth of Kentucky” written above it. The Tennessee state flag is red with a thin strip of blue and white on one end of the flag and a blue circle with three five-pointed stars in the center. Mr. Zorn, who could not be reached on Sunday, told WLNS that the history of the Confederate battle flag should be taught in schools. “It’s something we can’t just throw away because it is part of our history,” he said. “And if we want to make sure that the atrocities that happened during that time doesn’t happen again, we should be teaching it. Our kids should know what that flag stands for.” He said the mask he wore on the Senate floor was not made of “flag material.”In an interview with the television station, he wore a manufactured mask, saying he switched what he was wearing because “I didn’t want my actions to cause a negative effect to the institution,” alluding to the State Senate. Michigan abolished slavery and was admitted to the Union in 1837. Detroit became a stop on the Underground Railroad, a clandestine route for slaves fleeing to the North to be free. Embracing the Confederate battle flag can signal support for white supremacy or states’ rights, Jenna Bednar, a political-science professor at the University of Michigan, said on Sunday. “I have no idea what it means to him,” she said, referring to the senator.Professor Bednar said he could have worn the mask in support of states’ rights after President Trump criticized Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan for imposing strict stay-at-home directives during the coronavirus pandemic. “Let’s say he wanted to talk about states’ rights; this is a very interesting moment,” she said, adding that while she might show her students images of the Confederate battle flag while teaching, it would be very different if she wore a T-shirt depicting it. “As a university professor, I have to be very careful about how people interpret what I say, and the same is true about public service,” Professor Bednar said. “I would think that the flag of Michigan would be the more appropriate flag to wear.” Last week, the Marine Corps banned the public display of the Confederate battle flag. Gen. David H. Berger, the commandant, said it could cause division within the Corps. “I am mindful that many people believe that flag to be a symbol of heritage and regional pride,” he said in a letter. “But I am also mindful of the feelings of pain and rejection of those who inherited the cultural memory and present effects of the scourge of slavery in our country.” Across the country, Confederate monuments and symbols have been fraught with the country’s traumatic history of slavery. Some cities have removed the monuments and others have put such statues up for auction."
U.K. Coronavirus Briefings Offer a More Genteel Spin Than Trump’s,"LONDON — Each evening at the stroke of 5, a British cabinet minister and two expert advisers walk into a clubby, wood-paneled room at 10 Downing Street and take their places behind three socially distanced lecterns. The room is empty but for a large screen, which flickers with the images of journalists, most of them at home, who politely pepper the officials with questions about Britain’s response to the coronavirus. The experts show slides with bars and graphs, and the minister briskly ends the proceedings in under an hour. This is Britain’s answer to the White House’s daily coronavirus briefing — and except for the starting time, Downing Street’s genteel exercise is the antithesis of the fiery, freewheeling spectacle presided over by President Trump across the Atlantic. At one level, that is surprising. Britain has been hit hard by the pandemic and the government has come under fire for mishandling its response. Prime Minister Boris Johnson initially played down the threat in ways that echoed Mr. Trump, and British papers have published lengthy investigations of his missteps. But unlike at the White House, the Downing Street briefings have not become an arena for bitter recrimination or dubious science, to say nothing of wild speculation about injecting people with bleach to kill the virus. For starters, they have not been dominated by a single lightning-rod personality since Mr. Johnson was sidelined last month with his own case of the virus. He turned over the briefing duties to a rotating cast of ministers, who come across as earnest understudies. So there is none of the gladiatorial combat of Mr. Trump’s clashes with reporters, none of the awkward moments when the leader second-guesses the scientists and no fulsome expressions of praise by subordinates like Vice President Mike Pence. There is instead a sense of dutiful inquiry. The exchanges are unfailingly cordial — journalists preface follow-up questions with “if I may” — the atmosphere is cool and the conversation periodically veers into the academic, as ministers defer to the scientists to explain issues like whether the transmission rate of the virus has fallen to below one. For those missing tennis this summer, tuning in to Downing Street is like watching a crisp gentlemen’s match at Wimbledon. The White House briefing is more like a sweaty night of mixed doubles at Flushing Meadows during the U.S. Open. And yet, for all the cultural differences, there are deeper parallels between the sessions. Both governments are trying to shape the narrative of how they are handling the pandemic. Both are on the defensive. And both are led by populist politicians who bring campaign-style tactics to an unpredictable crisis. “Johnson and Trump are both much happier in campaign mode than governing mode,” said Alistair Campbell, who as the press secretary for Tony Blair when he was prime minister built a well-oiled P.R. machine. These days, Mr. Campbell said, he was spending “most of the time watching these wretched briefings,” not just Downing Street and the White House, but also those led by Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, whom he praises effusively. “Trump is clearly using his briefings with a campaign focus, to attack his opponents and galvanize his base,” Mr. Campbell said. “Johnson, less dangerously but just as politically, is using them to give the sense of being vaguely in control.” His ministers rarely concede that the government should have done anything differently, even though Britain’s soaring death toll puts it on a par with the worst-hit countries in Europe. They deflect questions about why they have tested so few people, or why hospital workers still do not have enough masks. “We must stick to the plan, and we must continue to be guided by the science,” said Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, on April 9, while refusing to give details about either. Mr. Johnson has deputized Mr. Raab to take over his duties temporarily, but the understudy has little of his boss’s charisma. When the questions get uncomfortable, the politicians dodge and weave. On April 10, a reporter asked the health secretary, Matt Hancock, how many health workers had died during the outbreak. “I think this is a question for you, Ruth,” Mr. Hancock said, tossing it to Ruth May, the nation’s chief nursing officer, who said it would be inappropriate to get into numbers. Things were a bit looser when Mr. Johnson was at the podium. Early in the crisis, he often appeared with the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. The news media nicknamed the trio “Boris and the boffins” — British slang for science mavens. On March 3, Mr. Johnson told reporters, who were then still seated in the room, that he had visited patients in a hospital. “I shook hands with everybody, you’ll be pleased to know,” he said, turning to Dr. Vallance for validation. “Wash your hands,” he replied, with a regretful shake of his head that was reminiscent of how Anthony S. Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, sometimes reacts to Mr. Trump. Mr. Johnson’s absence has made the briefings less riveting but perhaps more informative, because it encourages reporters to direct questions to the scientists. Some communications analysts said the lack of focus on a single person was a good thing — and one that should be emulated by Mr. Trump. “The president and the prime minister are catnip for a very frisky press corps,” said Ari Fleischer, who was press secretary to former President George W. Bush. “Without them,” he said, “you’d get different experts and different questions.” He said Mr. Trump should appear only three times a week, and there are signs the president may take his advice. But while Mr. Trump and Mr. Johnson are often compared, they are very different, not least in their communications style. Under Mr. Johnson, Downing Street has hammered a single message, centered on Britain’s National Health Service and emblazoned on the lecterns in the briefing room: “Stay Home. Protect the N.H.S. Save Lives.” Under Mr. Trump, the White House message shifts daily, depending on the whims of the man delivering it. “These are not sessions that provide clarity,” said Martha Joynt Kumar, an expert on White House communications. “There is more obfuscation than clarity.” When Mr. Trump’s name comes up, British officials tread gingerly.On Friday, Jenny Harries, who is a deputy to Dr. Whitty, the chief medical officer, was asked about the president’s reference to disinfectants. “I wouldn’t have a specific message to Donald Trump,” Dr. Harries said with a smile. “I’d have a specific message to anybody who suggested they should be injecting anything into their bodies.” That message was: Don’t do it.With moments like that, Downing Street’s briefings remain popular. They draw between 8 million and 9 million viewers on weekdays, well above the usual audience for BBC’s news shows, according to Enders Analysis, a media research firm in London. “The U.K. conferences are a genuine attempt to brief the nation, even if the poor quality of politicians and journalistic questioning means they don’t always succeed as well as they should,” said Andrew Neil, a prominent BBC host. “At least the intent is there,” he said. “The White House equivalents are largely platforms for a show-pony president.”"
Trump Turns Shared American Experiences Into Us vs. Them,"WASHINGTON — Last weekend, an anniversary of the kind that would have once united the country in reflection — the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, 25 years ago — passed without much in the way of comment. As the days inside pile up, our usual approach to a national moment of remembrance appeared lost to the fog of time, germs and Trump era news cycles. The lack of attention was cast in relief by one person who did speak up: Former President Bill Clinton, who for a variety of reasons seems to have receded from public view since his wife was defeated by Donald Trump for the presidency in 2016. Mr. Clinton, the embattled first-term president of early 1995, would become the dominant presence in the brittle aftermath of Oklahoma City. The various psychodramas of his two terms can obscure the significance of the incident as a political marker of that era; now, it is a global pandemic that is seizing attention from Washington traditions like civic remembrance and bipartisan affirmation. “In many ways, this is the perfect time to remember Oklahoma City and to repeat the promise we made to them in 1995 to all Americans today,” Mr. Clinton said in an op-ed that ran last Sunday in The Oklahoman. It’s easy to dismiss this as boilerplate pulled straight from the “stuff politicians say” binder. But its tone is also conspicuous in how it contrasts with the words to a nation in need of solace and mending that come from the current White House. One of the recurring features of the Trump years has been the president’s knack for detonating so many of our powerful shared experiences into us-versus-them grenades. Whether it’s the anniversary of a national catastrophe like the Oklahoma City bombing, the death of a widely admired statesman (Senator John McCain) or a lethal pathogen, Mr. Trump has exhibited minimal interest in the tradition of national strife placing a pause upon the usual smallness of politics. In this fractured political environment, the president has shown particular zest for identifying symbols that reveal and exacerbate cultural divisions. Kneeling football players, plastic straws and the question of whether a commander in chief should be trumpeting an untested antimalarial drug from the White House briefing room have all become fast identifiers of what team you’re on. Looming sickness and mass death are no exception. The reflex to unite during a period of collective grief feels like another casualty of the current moment. It used to be a norm, back before everything got stripped down to its noisiest culture war essence. Tradition dictated that whenever a national loss or trauma occurred, political combatants would stand down, at least for a time. President George W. Bush could embrace Senator Tom Daschle, then the Democratic majority leader, after an emotional address that Mr. Bush delivered to a joint session of congress in the days after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. President Barack Obama did the same with Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, when Mr. Obama visited the state and saw the devastation of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. To varying degrees, both Mr. Daschle and Mr. Christie caught heat from within their parties after the crises faded into the past and partisan engines revved up again. At the time, though, the gestures felt appropriate and stature-enhancing for everyone involved. Those dynamics have since shifted considerably. “I think we’re dealing with a whole different world and set of personalities,” said Mr. Daschle, now a former senator from South Dakota, adding that acts of solidarity during adverse times benefit all parties. “I remember after 9/11, congressional approval was something like in the ’80s, and for the president it was around the same,” he said. Oklahoma City also offered a political gift to Mr. Clinton, a battered leader whose party had lost control of Congress the year before and who had, a few days earlier, found himself defending the “relevance” of his office. Mr. Clinton performed his role of eulogist and comforter, won bipartisan praise for his “performance” and an increase of good will that would eventually help right his presidency on a path to his re-election in 1996. Mr. Clinton, historians said, always appreciated the power of big, bipartisan gestures, even when they involved incendiary rivals. “He understood the healing powers of the presidency,” said Ted Widmer, a presidential historian at City University of New York, and a former adviser to Mr. Clinton who assisted him in writing his memoirs. He mentioned a generous eulogy that Mr. Clinton delivered for disgraced former President Richard Nixon, after he died in 1994. “There is a basic impulse a president can have for when the country wants their leader to rise above politics and mudslinging,” Mr. Widmer said. In that regard, Mr. Trump’s performance during this pandemic has been a missed opportunity. “The coronavirus could have been Donald Trump’s finest hour,” Mr. Widmer said. “You really sensed that Americans wanted to be brought together. But now that appears unattainable.” For whatever reason, Mr. Trump seems uninterested in setting aside personal resentment, even when some small gestures — a photo op or a joint statement with Democratic leaders in Congress; a bipartisan pandemic commission chaired by former presidents — could score him easy statesmanship points. His unwillingness to deal in any way with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (they have reportedly not spoken since the House voted to impeach Mr. Trump in January) has rendered him a bystander during negotiations with Congress on massive economic recovery bills that were by and large led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He has taken shots at popular Democratic governors in the hard-hit states of Washington and of Michigan; his approval ratings are dipping — and lag behind that of most governors. Supporters of Mr. Trump say they appreciate that he doesn’t betray his true feelings for the sake of adhering to Beltway happy talk. This resolve appears central to his credibility with them. They elected him to disrupt, not to play nice and don a mask, whether made of artifice or cloth. This weekend was supposed to mark another of those pauses in D.C. hostilities, albeit of a very different nature: the annual White House Correspondents’ Dinner, the spring tradition that brings together a hair-sprayed throng along a pecking order of A- to D-list celebrities. The festivities are embedded with the ostensibly high-minded purpose of saluting the First Amendment and raising money for journalism scholarships. If you can score yourself a selfie with Gayle King, all the better. In the view of many inside the Beltway, the correspondents’ dinner had long outlived its appeal and probably should have been canceled well before Covid-19 did the trick this year (the dinner has been postponed until August). Regardless, presidents of both parties would reliably show up, if only as a gesture of good faith or nod to a local bipartisan tradition. But Mr. Trump — a veteran of the dinners in his pre-political days, including a memorable evening in which he endured a brutal roasting at the hands of then-President Barack Obama in 2011 — wanted no part of the correspondents’ dinner from the outset of his presidency. Instead, he would take the opportunity to hold “alternative programming” events in the form of Saturday night rallies in places like Pennsylvania, deftly placing himself in populist opposition to the preening Tux-and-Gowned creatures of the swamp. Mr. Trump’s arrival in Washington inspired another counter-programing surrogate for the main event when the comedian Samantha Bee, host of the TBS program “Full Frontal,” started her own production across town, called “Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner.” There, she would toss affectionate barbs at the assembled press, usually at the expense of Mr. Trump. “You continue to fact-check the president,” she said in 2017, “as if he might actually someday get embarrassed.” Beyond the excesses of the White House Correspondents' Dinner, for a president to partake of this tradition also requires an ability to be a good sport. The guest of honor will inevitably suffer good-natured ribbing at the hands of the hired comedian (or, better yet, not-so-good-natured ribbing — the most memorable routine occurring in 2006, when Stephen Colbert unleashed a sarcastic takedown of then-President George W. Bush and the press corps that Mr. Colbert pointedly suggested had coddled him). The exercise also requires a president with at least minimal skill at solemnly paying heed to the principles that brought everyone together in the first place. First among these is the preservation of a free and fair press, not something a president fond of the term “fake news” will ever be synonymous with. Still, for the many Washingtonians lucky enough to be working from home, six weeks being trapped indoors and fighting with family members about dishes can breed nostalgia for even the most played-out D.C. tradition. The correspondents’ dinner might confirm every worst stereotype of a full-of-itself political class. But anything that involves getting dressed up and actually doing stuff with other people sounds appetizing right about now, especially if it doesn’t involve Zoom."
"Americans Abroad Ask Whether to Stay, and Risk Infection, or Fly Home, and Risk Infection","WASHINGTON — The travel plan was as exhausting as it was risky for the 77-year-old cancer survivor wondering how to leave self-isolation in Ecuador and return home to New Hampshire without catching the coronavirus. “It’s not for the faint of heart and promises to be very grueling, but we wanted to gauge interest,” the American Embassy in Quito, Ecuador, wrote in a notice last month to Americans looking to get back to the United States as the deadly pandemic spread. It was a nonstarter for Bob Rand, who remains in Ecuador with an immune system already compromised from previous rounds of chemotherapy to treat Stage 4 cancer. He makes annual trips there to visit a son working in Quito. But it turned out to be the last U.S. government flight out of Ecuador, leaving few, if any, options available for American citizens trying to avoid becoming sick. The March 29 itinerary called for Mr. Rand and other travelers to take a C-130 military cargo plane to Panama, where they would remain onboard for a 12-hour layover. They would have no food or water, except what they carried in the single 50-pound bag each passenger was allowed to bring. From Panama, they would fly to a naval base in Norfolk, Va., and passengers would have to find their own transportation the rest of the way home. For Mr. Rand, that meant booking a commercial flight or renting a car for the trip back to North Hampton, N.H. — almost certainly coming into contact with people who had not spent weeks in isolation, as he had. “But at the end of the day, you’ll be back in the United States and will have a great story to tell,” the embassy said in its notice. Mr. Rand does not regret passing up the cargo flight. “That would have been tough on me,” he said this week in a telephone interview.  But a month later, and with coronavirus cases doubling by the week in Ecuador, Mr. Rand now wonders whether he would be better off taking one of a dwindling number of weekly commercial flights to the United States — even if it means interacting with strangers who ultimately could infect him. “I think I’d rather be home surrounded by doctors than be sick down here,” he said.Those who had assumed they could stay overseas, and wait for the pandemic to ebb, now face an unnerving choice: Either stick it out, and prepare for the possibility they will be infected with the virus and treated in foreign hospitals, or chance catching it on the way back to the United States. The State Department is winding down government-organized flights that have so far brought home 65,000 Americans from across the world. Some continue in limited numbers, in areas like the Indian subcontinent and Africa, but “these flights will not go on forever,” Ian Brownlee, a deputy assistant secretary of state, told reporters on Wednesday. The department is also helping commercial airlines cut through foreign regulations that have restricted flights during the pandemic. At least four flights carrying Americans to the United States left Peru over the last week, officials said, after diplomats lobbied the government in Lima to ease its closed borders. But there still are at least 17,000 American citizens or legal residents abroad who have indicated they need help and, at this point, the State Department is urging them to take any available flights out. Dr. William Walters, the State Department’s deputy chief medical officer, said the risk of catching the virus was nearly as high on the government-sponsored flights as it was on commercial airlines. What will make a difference in Americans’ health, he said, is where they will be able to get medical treatment. “You can come back to the United States where you are a citizen and you have access to health care and you have access to an infrastructure that is still intact,” Dr. Walters said. But by hunkering down, in developing countries in particular, where the virus has yet to peak, “you will be an American citizen in a foreign country that didn’t have great infrastructure to begin with,” he said. “And now you have less rights and less access to less infrastructure.” Mr. Brownlee warned that commercial flights to the United States also might end in the coming days — making it all the more urgent for Americans to grab any opportunities “while they exist.” More than half of the Americans the State Department has helped so far were departing from countries in Central and South America; an additional 4,000 are still seeking assistance, Mr. Brownlee said. Hundreds of thousands of Americans live in Brazil, Mr. Brownlee said, but there are now fewer than a dozen flights to the United States each week. The number of commercial flights from Honduras, Guatemala and Ecuador have also decreased in recent days. The death toll in Ecuador during the outbreak was 15 times higher than the official number of coronavirus deaths reported by the government, according to an analysis by The New York Times. The numbers suggest that the South American country is suffering one of the worst outbreaks in the world. The State Department so far has helped more than 3,500 Americans leave Ecuador, including more than 110 this week. But Mr. Rand so far has been unable to book a seat. As he considers where he might receive medical treatment should he need it, Mr. Rand has grown increasingly anxious. Most well-equipped private hospitals in Quito are not treating coronavirus patients, he said, and the public hospitals are already overextended. He is now hoping to fly out on a United Airlines flight next week that will route him from Quito through Houston for an overnight layover, and then to Chicago, before he arrives in Boston — ironically, as many transfers as the trip on the U.S. military cargo plane. But at least he will be back in the United States. “Things could get tricky here,” said Mr. Rand, who has been in self-isolation in Ecuador with his son and a small group of friends since March 16. “I’m beginning to think, ‘Uh-oh.’”"
Prescriptions Surged as Trump Praised Drugs in Coronavirus Fight,"It was at a midday briefing last month that President Trump first used the White House telecast to promote two antimalarial drugs in the fight against the coronavirus. “I think it could be something really incredible,” Mr. Trump said on March 19, noting that while more study was needed, the two drugs had shown “very, very encouraging results” in treating the virus. By that evening, first-time prescriptions of the drugs — chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine — poured into retail pharmacies at more than 46 times the rate of the average weekday, according to an analysis of prescription data by The New York Times. And the nearly 32,000 prescriptions came from across the spectrum — rheumatologists, cardiologists, dermatologists, psychiatrists and even podiatrists, the data shows. While medical experts have since stepped up warnings about the drugs’ possibly dangerous side effects, they were still being prescribed at more than six times the normal rate during the second week of April, the analysis shows. All the while, Mr. Trump continued to extol their use. “It’s having some very good results, I’ll tell you,” he said in a White House briefing on April 13. The extraordinary change in prescribing patterns reflects, at least in part, the outsize reach of the Trump megaphone, even when his pronouncements distort scientific evidence or run counter to the recommendations of experts in his own administration. It also offers the clearest evidence yet of the perils of a president willing to push unproven and potentially dangerous remedies to a public desperate for relief from the pandemic. On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration warned against using the drugs outside a hospital setting or clinical trial because they could lead to serious heart rhythm problems in some coronavirus patients. Days earlier, the federal agency led by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci — one of Mr. Trump’s top advisers on the pandemic — issued cautionary advice on the drugs, and stated that there was no proven medication to treat the virus. As the prescriptions surged in the second half of March, the largest volumes per capita included states hit hardest by coronavirus, like New York and New Jersey. Georgia, Arkansas and Kentucky were other states with relatively high per-capita figures. In absolute numbers, California and Washington, the earliest-hit states, were among the largest. The biggest number in either category was in Florida, where nearly one prescription was written for every thousand residents. Carmen Catizone, executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, said the surge created shortages that “put patients at risk who depend on these medications” to treat other illnesses. “The fact that people reacted to what the White House said in such a way — in the 35 years I’ve been in pharmacy and pharmacy regulation, I’ve never seen that before,” he said. More than 40,000 health care professionals were first-time prescribers of the drugs in March, according to the data, which is anonymized and based on insurance claims filed for about 300 million patients in the United States, representing approximately 90 percent of the country’s population. The data is current through April 14. The data was compiled by IPM.ai, a subsidiary of Swoop, a company in Cambridge, Mass., that specializes in health care data and analytics based on artificial intelligence. It does not include drugs prescribed to patients in hospitals, where some doctors have administered the medication, or those released to hospitals from the Strategic National Stockpile. The data provided to The Times did not include the identities of the prescribers or the patients. After Mr. Trump’s remarks last month, retail pharmacies across the country reported a run on the drugs, which are mostly prescribed by a small subset of medical specialists. Within days, states began issuing emergency orders to restrict the new prescriptions. Gwendolyn Young walked into her pharmacy in Los Angeles four days after the president’s March 19 briefing, trying to pick up a 90-day prescription of hydroxychloroquine. She has taken the medication for more than 30 years to treat lupus. The drug, while approved for malaria, is also used to treat lupus and other autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. Hundreds of thousands of patients across the United States rely on it to keep painful symptoms at bay. At the pharmacy, Ms. Young said, she was told to start rationing her pills because the drug was being given only to patients who had Covid-19. She was eventually able to get a 14-day supply, but the uncertainty has made her anxious. “Will I have to keep doing this every 14 days?” she said. “What happens to those people who don’t push the way I do?” Although the availability of hydroxychloroquine has improved in recent weeks, the Food and Drug Administration still lists it as being in short supply. Mike Donnelly, vice president of communications for the Lupus Foundation of America, said that the organization received calls and emails daily from patients who were told their prescription could be filled only in part or not at all. A spokesman for the Arthritis Foundation said some patients received their refills only after calling around to as many as a dozen pharmacies. In the past month, about 40 states have intervened in some manner to quell the frenzy.Idaho was the first to take a hard line, issuing a temporary rule on the same day that Mr. Trump first mentioned the drugs in his daily briefing. The rule banned pharmacists from dispensing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine unless the prescription included a written diagnosis of a condition that the drugs had been proved to treat. The rule also limited prescriptions to a 14-day supply unless a patient had previously taken the medication. The director of Idaho’s State Board of Pharmacy said at the time that many of the prescriptions were being written by doctors for themselves and their family members, a trend reported by other state boards as well. Some of those writing prescriptions for themselves may have been on the front lines treating patients; the data shows an uptick among health care practitioners working in emergency medicine. More broadly, the analysis indicates a major shift in the kinds of medical practitioners writing the prescriptions, based on prescribing patterns in retail pharmacies since 2016. Historically, the majority of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine prescriptions have come out of a narrow band of specialties like rheumatology. That changed last month, when the specialties reflected in the data included larger numbers of those working in dermatology, ophthalmology, podiatry, urology and other areas. In the past six weeks, Dr. Niran Al-Agba, a pediatrician in Silverdale, Wash., has prescribed chloroquine to a handful of adults she considered high risk for Covid-19 — among them, her 76-year-old mother, who works in her medical office. Dr. Al-Agba said she began researching the drugs in early March after the death of a Seattle-area man, who at the time was the first known virus-related fatality in the United States. She concluded from her research that chloroquine might help, and she didn’t see any harm in writing a short prescription. “It’s just really hard to look at your mother and not try,” she said.Dr. Al-Agba instructed her mother to take the pills only if she spiked a fever, which she has not. She still has the pills. For Dr. Blake Williamson, an ophthalmologist in Louisiana, it came down to writing a prescription for himself. He worries about his close contact with patients and with his 84-year-old father-in-law, who is undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer and helps care for his three children. He took a short, prophylactic course of hydroxychloroquine after reading studies from Europe that he thought were promising, and on advice from other physicians. Dr. Williamson said he thought he did the right thing, especially given his continued exposure to emergency patients in an area hit hard by the pandemic. “My goal was simply not to be an asymptomatic carrier who could harm patients or at-risk family members and not even know it,” he wrote in an email. The interest in taking chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a possible treatment did not originate with Mr. Trump. Reports from doctors in China and France that the drugs might help patients fueled interest in scientific and medical communities in the United States. Conservative media, in particular, trumpeted the drugs’ potential effectiveness, and the data shows prescriptions had already increased two and a half times over the weekday average during the week before Mr. Trump’s March 19 briefing. Mr. Trump soon extended his interest to a combination of one of those drugs, hydroxychloroquine, with an antibiotic, azithromycin. “HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE & AZITHROMYCIN, taken together, have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” he wrote in a post to Twitter around 10 a.m. on March 21, a Saturday. The tweet coincided with a weekend flood of prescriptions for the two antimalarial drugs. By the end of the day, the prescriptions had increased 114 times at retail pharmacies compared with the average weekend day, according to The Times analysis. On Tuesday, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, led by Dr. Fauci, issued guidelines against the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin except in clinical trials, with experts citing “the potential for toxicities.” Enthusiasm for the drugs has been waning over the past couple weeks, including at Mr. Trump’s own news conferences and among researchers. A small trial in Brazil of chloroquine was halted after coronavirus patients taking higher doses developed irregular heart rates that increased their risk of a potentially fatal heart arrhythmia. A study of 368 patients in U.S. veterans hospitals found that hydroxychloroquine was associated with an increased death rate; the drug, used with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, also did not help patients avoid the need for ventilators. (The veterans study was not a controlled trial, and neither study has been peer-reviewed.) Mr. Trump was asked about the veterans study at his briefing on Tuesday.“Obviously, there have been some very good reports and perhaps this one is not a good report,” he said. By Thursday, Mr. Trump had moved on to a different subject, raising a question at his White House briefing about the use of disinfectants to kill the coronavirus inside the body. The remarks were followed by dire warnings from state health officials, who were inundated with requests for information about such a course of action. The president’s press secretary tried to make the case the comments were taken out of context by the news media, and Mr. Trump later insisted he had only been kidding.

A Candidate in Isolation: Inside Joe Biden’s Cloistered Campaign,"Joseph R. Biden Jr. usually rises before 8 a.m. at his home in Wilmington, Del., and starts his day with a workout in an upstairs gym that contains a Peloton bike, weights and a treadmill. He often enjoys a protein shake for breakfast and puts on a suit or blazer much of the time. In the evenings, he and his wife, Jill, sit down together for dinner, a ritual that was absent for much of the last frenzied year on the campaign trail. In the intervening hours, Mr. Biden attempts to win the presidency without leaving his house.With the coronavirus outbreak freezing the country’s public life, Mr. Biden has been forced to adapt to a cloistered mode of campaigning never before seen in modern American politics. He was unable to embark on a victory tour after the Democratic primaries or hold unity rallies with onetime rivals like Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Instead, the former vice president is in a distinctive kind of lockdown, walled off from voters, separated from his top strategists and yet leading in the polls. For a famous backslapper like Mr. Biden, this open-ended period of captivity has tested both his patience and his political imagination. He has lamented being deprived of human contact, and he has expressed exasperation with media coverage critiquing his limited visibility compared with President Trump’s daily performances in the White House briefing room. He does not make a habit of watching the president’s briefings in full; he is said to be fixated mainly on the eventual challenge — if he wins — of governing amid a pandemic. Interviews with dozens of people in touch with the presumptive Democratic nominee and his advisers revealed a newly detailed picture of Mr. Biden’s life in seclusion, one spent in long-distance consultation with a wide array of coalition leaders helping him map out the fall campaign and a potential administration. Mr. Biden has revived many of the rituals of the vice presidency, including similarly formatted briefing memos and tour d’horizon-style updates from aides on the virus and the economy — all aimed at giving him the information he would need to make the weighty decisions at hand if he were in charge, except that he is not. Fran Person, who served for years as a Biden aide and speaks with him regularly, said the detached lifestyle was unnatural for Mr. Biden, an extrovert who spent virtually his entire adult life in government. “I can imagine, for him, you’re watching this play out, you know what needs to get done,” Mr. Person said. “You want to be right in the middle of it.” As the temperature of the campaign rises in public, increasingly featuring caustic attacks on Mr. Biden from Mr. Trump and his allies and blunt rebuttals from Mr. Biden’s aides, the former vice president has not attempted to match Mr. Trump blow for blow on television. For the most part, Mr. Biden is seeking to run a campaign based on something like digital-age fireside chats, offering himself as a calmly authoritative figure rather than a brawler like his opponent. In private, he voices a combination of optimism about American resilience and recognition that the country is likely to be in a bleak state on Inauguration Day. It remains to be seen whether that approach will come to be viewed as appropriately sober or perilously passive against a tenacious and unpredictable opponent. Many Democrats remain anxious about the limitations of Mr. Biden’s position, even though Mr. Trump has slipped markedly in the polls and faces growing disapproval of his response to the pandemic. Only a few people have seen Mr. Biden, 77, in the flesh in recent weeks. He is guarded by the Secret Service, and a pair of trusted staffers assist with his daily activities. The rare outside visitors don masks and gloves as a safety measure. Like many professionals these days, the former vice president fills his time with conference calls. There are at least four standing calls on his daily schedule, including one with Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, his new campaign manager. There are daily briefings on the economy, public health and electoral strategy, and a less frequent session on national security. Mr. Biden has used a television-quality video uplink from his refurbished rec room for interviews and online campaign events. But for private conversations, he prefers conferring by telephone, usually on speakerphone in his study. At times, callers deduce from rowdy background noise that Mr. Biden is working beside his German shepherds, Major and Champ. The former vice president also places calls to mayors and governors; congressional leaders like Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina; elder statesmen like Al Gore; potential running mates; donors; and former rivals like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. A few governors have become favorite points of contact, including Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, Jay Inslee of Washington and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. At his request, Mr. Biden talks at least once daily to a voter or campaign volunteer — the kind of people he would meet constantly on the trail. And he regularly phones allies to express sympathy or support, including a call to Ms. Warren when he learned that one of her brothers had died of the coronavirus. Ms. Whitmer, a potential running mate for Mr. Biden, said the former vice president had been deeply engaged with the details of the outbreak in her state. He had offered advice and commiserated over the isolation brought on by the virus, and how it had barred them from performing consoling tasks like visiting mourners and medical workers. “I think that’s why he’s calling and reaching out and trying to keep a pulse on what’s happening,” Ms. Whitmer said. “It’s not a great substitute for personal interaction, but it’s a way to stay connected.” The Biden campaign declined to make him available for an interview. But the former vice president has at times spoken publicly about his isolation. “I’m chomping at the bit,” Mr. Biden told reporters a month ago. “I wish I were still in the Senate, you know, being able to impact on some of these things. But I am where I am.’’ For a team that employed a relatively skeletal digital operation throughout the primaries, the sudden shift toward online campaigning has been abrupt. At times, Mr. Biden has appeared out of his comfort zone and he continues to express a kind of chuckling disbelief that his basement has become a makeshift studio. Advisers acknowledge that they have considerable catching up to do on sites like Facebook and YouTube. Mr. Biden is also facing pressure from donors to ramp up his at-home fund-raising activities, and from leaders in the states who want to see him beaming more often into key battlegrounds. To that end, he has recently conducted a series of interviews with local television stations in markets like Detroit and Pittsburgh, with more planned. But Mr. Biden is burrowing in for the long haul, telling donors this month he did not anticipate holding traditional public events anytime soon. “It’s going to be this way,” he said, “for a little while.” An Extrovert in LockdownThe estate on which Mr. Biden is functionally trapped has long been a personal refuge. Nestled along a lake and recessed from the road by a long private drive, the 6,800-square-foot home took more than two years to build and Mr. Biden has said he designed it himself.  It is a home the Bidens had talked about bequeathing to his son, Beau, and that Mr. Biden later considered mortgaging or selling to help support Beau’s family as he suffered from cancer. It was at this home where Mr. Biden worked to refine the 2016 presidential announcement speech he never delivered. Today, the house has become an almost sealed containment zone. Two political aides regularly enter and leave the house, according to people briefed on the safety restrictions put in place: Annie Tomasini, Mr. Biden’s traveling chief of staff, and Anthony Bernal, Jill Biden’s chief of staff, both of whom have worked for the Bidens on and off for more than a decade. But several people familiar with their roles said they are not staffing the Bidens around the clock and it is not clear whether any other aides assist the candidate at home. Much of the time Mr. Biden answers his own telephone, and he frequently falls behind his limited public schedule. The campaign has consulted physicians and health experts about safeguarding Mr. Biden, who at 77 falls squarely into a high-risk group for the coronavirus. Irwin Redlener, a clinical professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, said he had spoken with the campaign about health precautions, including how to handle the possibility that members of Mr. Biden’s traveling staff had been exposed. “In terms of the safety of the staff, the candidate, what did they need to know?” said Dr. Redlener, who previously served on Mr. Biden’s public health advisory committee. Mr. Biden has embraced the safety guidelines: He has described in interviews a careful protocol that allows him to interact with some of his grandchildren, who live nearby. They come over to play on his lawn, allowing Mr. Biden and Jill Biden to talk to them and sometimes throw them candy or ice cream from a short distance.  To interact with voters, his campaign has experimented with virtual town halls and round tables, but Democrats in the states are anxious to see more of the candidate. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who recently endorsed Mr. Biden, said he had prodded the campaign to do more to put him directly in front of Wisconsin voters. “It is so critically important for him to have a presence here,” Mr. Barrett said. “I think, in some ways, Zoom and FaceTime — they’re the 2020 counterpart to what President Trump used effectively for his base, which is Twitter.” Mr. Biden is working to adapt to those platforms; this past week he spent half an hour on a Zoom call with a nurse in Wisconsin and then contacted other members of her family by phone. But targeted video-chatting offers Mr. Biden only so many opportunities to hear from voters directly about their struggles and needs. Ashley Ruiz, a voter in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., who recently participated in a “virtual rope line” with Mr. Biden, said she had found him eager to share his ideas about education and child care. But Mr. Biden grew most animated when he detected the presence of her two sons — ages 10 and 7 — along with her red-nose pit bull, Kacie. Mr. Biden, she said, was determined to communicate with her 7-year-old son, who has autism and, like Mr. Biden, a stutter. “He said to my son, ‘I want you to know you can do anything,’” Ms. Ruiz said, recalling that Mr. Biden had told her, “When I’m president, I will care for your family like they’re my family.” Defining the substance behind that promise is what mainly occupies Mr. Biden’s time. Seeking Bigger IdeasEven before Mr. Biden entered his state of near-quarantine, he was telling associates that he feared the onset of a national catastrophe. In mid-March, Mr. Biden told one confidant that he was concerned that the country could face another Great Depression, sharing that he had discussed the possibility with Lawrence H. Summers, the former treasury secretary. That dark contingency now looks more plausible than ever. In the daily briefings he receives about public health and the economy, Mr. Biden seeks the kind of minute information he would need to make important policy decisions — if only he were in a position to do so. Several participants in the briefings said Mr. Biden probes extensively about the mechanics of how money and medical resources are being distributed around the country. Spurred by beleaguered governors, he regularly presses his team about the steps Washington might take to shore up shattered state budgets. “There is that sort of suspended quality to things in that you’re not making a decision that’s urgent and that people have to carry out today,” said Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close Biden ally. Still, he described “a real sense of imminence” because the aides briefing Mr. Biden in lockdown today could well be managing the government response in 10 months. “It’s like the relief pitcher warming up in the bullpen, knowing you only get a couple more pitches and then you’re going out on the mound,” Mr. Coons said.  One of those advisers, Vivek Murthy, the former surgeon general, said Mr. Biden wanted to stay on top of both the large-scale policies aimed at containing the virus and on the precise efforts of local governments and medical facilities. Though most people on the calls are former government officials, a view from the front lines of medicine comes from a member of the Biden family: Howard Krein, the former vice president’s son-in-law, who is a doctor in Philadelphia. In one briefing, Dr. Murthy said it hit Mr. Biden hard to learn that hospitals were barring people from visiting dying family members. “He knows what it’s like to lose people and to have your life turned upside down,” Dr. Murthy said. A daily call on the economy and a somewhat less frequent briefing on national security are stocked with veterans of the Obama administration, including Ben Harris and Jared Bernstein, who served as economic advisers to Mr. Biden in the vice presidency, and Antony J. Blinken and Jake Sullivan, his former national security advisers. Murmurs about Mr. Summers’s quiet role advising Mr. Biden have alarmed some progressives, who saw the former Harvard president as closely aligned with Wall Street during the last recession. It is not clear, however, that any ideological camp has a full claim on Mr. Biden’s ear right now: On the economic calls, Mr. Biden regularly seeks insight into the thinking of his party’s populist wing, inquiring by name about Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and a third liberal, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. So far, Mr. Biden’s policy huddles have yielded proposals to contain the immediate damage of the pandemic. But his allies expect he will soon go substantially further with a national-emergency agenda, likely to include huge new promises on economic stimulus, infrastructure, climate change and student debt.  The test ahead for him, however, is not just defining a bold agenda, but also communicating it from a desk in his house as Mr. Trump makes ruthless use of his bully pulpit. Mr. Inslee, who endorsed Mr. Biden on Wednesday after conferring with him privately about broadening his climate agenda, said he urged Mr. Biden to put safety first. Democrats, he said, “understand that we’re not going to hear from our candidate as much as we would if we didn’t have a pandemic.” “It’s really important that he take care of his health right now,” Mr. Inslee said. “It’s important for all of us.”"
"Nervous Republicans See Trump Sinking, and Taking Senate With Him","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s erratic handling of the coronavirus outbreak, the worsening economy and a cascade of ominous public and private polling have Republicans increasingly nervous that they are at risk of losing the presidency and the Senate if Mr. Trump does not put the nation on a radically improved course. The scale of the G.O.P.’s challenge has crystallized in the last week. With 26 million Americans now having filed for unemployment benefits, Mr. Trump’s standing in states that he carried in 2016 looks increasingly wobbly: New surveys show him trailing significantly in battleground states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, and he is even narrowly behind in must-win Florida. Democrats raised substantially more money than Republicans did in the first quarter in the most pivotal congressional races, according to recent campaign finance reports. And while Mr. Trump is well ahead in money compared with the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democratic donors are only beginning to focus on the general election, and several super PACs plan to spend heavily on behalf of him and the party. Perhaps most significantly, Mr. Trump’s single best advantage as an incumbent — his access to the bully pulpit — has effectively become a platform for self-sabotage. His daily news briefings on the coronavirus outbreak are inflicting grave damage on his political standing, Republicans believe, and his recent remarks about combating the virus with sunlight and disinfectant were a breaking point for a number of senior party officials. On Friday evening, Mr. Trump conducted only a short briefing and took no questions, a format that a senior administration official said was being discussed as the best option for the president going forward. Glen Bolger, a longtime Republican pollster, said the landscape for his party had become far grimmer compared with the pre-virus plan to run almost singularly around the country’s prosperity. “With the economy in free-fall, Republicans face a very challenging environment and it’s a total shift from where we were a few months ago,” Mr. Bolger said. “Democrats are angry, and now we have the foundation of the campaign yanked out from underneath us.” Mr. Trump’s advisers and allies have often blamed external events for his most self-destructive acts, such as his repeated outbursts during the two-year investigation into his campaign’s dealings with Russia. Now, there is no such explanation — and, so far, there have been exceedingly few successful interventions regarding Mr. Trump’s behavior at the podium. Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said the president had to change his tone and offer more than a campaign of grievance. “You got to have some hope to sell people,” Mr. Cole said. “But Trump usually sells anger, division and ‘we’re the victim.’” There are still more than six months until the election, and many Republicans are hoping that the dynamics of the race will shift once Mr. Biden is thrust back into the campaign spotlight. At that point, they believe, the race will not simply be the up-or-down referendum on the president it is now, and Mr. Trump will be able to more effectively sell himself as the person to rebuild the economy. [Read about Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s cloistered mode of campaigning during the coronavirus lockdown.] “We built the greatest economy in the world; I’ll do it a second time,” Mr. Trump said earlier this month, road-testing a theme he will deploy in the coming weeks. Still, a recent wave of polling has fueled Republican anxieties, as Mr. Biden leads in virtually every competitive state. The surveys also showed Republican senators in Arizona, Colorado, North Carolina and Maine trailing or locked in a dead heat with potential Democratic rivals — in part because their fate is linked to Mr. Trump’s job performance. If incumbents in those states lose, and Republicans pick up only the Senate seat in Alabama, Democrats would take control of the chamber should Mr. Biden win the presidency. “He’s got to run very close for us to keep the Senate,” Charles R. Black Jr., a veteran Republican consultant, said of Mr. Trump. “I’ve always thought we were favored to, but I can’t say that now with all these cards up in the air.” Republicans were taken aback this past week by the results of a 17-state survey commissioned by the Republican National Committee. It found the president struggling in the Electoral College battlegrounds and likely to lose without signs of an economic rebound this fall, according to a party strategist outside the R.N.C. who is familiar with the poll’s results. The Trump campaign’s own surveys have also shown an erosion of support, according to four people familiar with the data, as the coronavirus remains the No. 1 issue worrying voters. Polling this early is, of course, not determinative: In 2016 Hillary Clinton also enjoyed a wide advantage in many states well before November. Yet Mr. Trump’s best hope to win a state he lost in 2016, Minnesota, also seems increasingly challenging. A Democratic survey taken by Senator Tina Smith showed the president trailing by 10 percentage points there, according to a Democratic strategist who viewed the poll. The private data of the two parties is largely mirrored by public surveys. Just last week, three Pennsylvania polls and two Michigan surveys were released showing Mr. Trump losing outside the margin of error. And a pair of Florida polls were released that showed Mr. Biden enjoying a slim advantage in a state that is all but essential for Republicans to retain the presidency. To some in the party, this feels all too similar to the last time they held the White House.In 2006, anger at President George W. Bush and unease with the Iraq war propelled Democrats to reclaim Congress; two years later they captured the presidency thanks to the same anti-incumbent themes and an unexpected crisis that accelerated their advantage, the economic collapse of 2008. The two elections were effectively a single continuous rejection of Republican rule, as some in the G.O.P. fear 2018 and 2020 could become in a worst-case scenario. “It already feels very similar to the 2008 cycle,” said Billy Piper, a Republican lobbyist and former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell. Significant questions remain that could tilt the outcome of this election: whether Americans experience a second wave of the virus in the fall, the condition of the economy and how well Mr. Biden performs after he emerges from his Wilmington, Del., basement, which many in his party are privately happy to keep him in so long as Mr. Trump is fumbling as he governs amid a crisis. But if Republicans are comforted by the uncertainties that remain, they are alarmed by one element of this election that is already abundantly clear: The small-dollar fund-raising energy Democrats enjoyed in the midterms has not abated. Most of the incumbent House Democrats facing competitive races enjoy a vast financial advantage over Republican challengers, who are struggling to garner attention as the virus overwhelms news coverage.  Still, few officials in either party believed the House was in play this year. There was also similar skepticism about the Senate. Then the virus struck and fund-raising reports covering the first three months of this year were released in mid-April.  Republican senators facing difficult races were not only all outraised by Democrats, they were also overwhelmed. In Maine, for example, Senator Susan Collins brought in $2.4 million while her little-known rival, the House speaker Sara Gideon, raised more than $7 million. Even more concerning to Republicans is the lesser-known Thom Tillis of North Carolina. Republican officials are especially irritated at Mr. Tillis because he has little small-dollar support and raised only $2.1 million, which was more than doubled by his Democratic opponent. “These Senate first-quarter fund-raising numbers are a serious wake-up call for the G.O.P.,” said Scott Reed, the top political strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Republican Senate woes come as anger toward Mr. Trump is rising from some of the party’s most influential figures on Capitol Hill. After working closely with Senate Republicans at the start of the year, some of the party’s top congressional strategists say the handful of political advisers Mr. Trump retains have communicated little with them since the health crisis began. In a campaign steered by Mr. Trump, whose rallies drove fund-raising and data harvesting, the center of gravity has of late shifted to the White House. His campaign headquarters will remain closed for another few weeks, and West Wing officials say the president’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, hasn’t been to the White House since last month, though he is in touch by phone. Then there is the president’s conduct.In just the last week, he has undercut the efforts of his campaign and his allies to attack Mr. Biden on China; suddenly proposed a halt on immigration; and said governors should not move too soon to reopen their economies — a week after calling on protesters to “liberate” their states. And that was all before his digression into the potential healing powers of disinfectants. Republican lawmakers have gone from watching his lengthy daily briefings with a tight-lipped grimace to looking upon them with horror. “Any of us can be onstage too much,” said the longtime Representative Greg Walden of Oregon, noting that “there’s a burnout factor no matter who you are, you’ve got to think about that.” Privately, other party leaders are less restrained about the political damage they believe Mr. Trump is doing to himself and Republican candidates. One prominent G.O.P. senator said the nightly sessions were so painful he could not bear watching any longer. “I would urge the president to focus on the positive, all that has been done and how we are preparing for a possible renewal of the pandemic in the fall,” said Representative Peter King, Republican of New York. Asked about concerns over Mr. Trump’s briefings, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said, “Millions and millions of Americans tune in each day to hear directly from President Trump and appreciate his leadership, unprecedented coronavirus response, and confident outlook for America’s future.” Mr. Trump’s thrashing about partly reflects his frustration with the virus and his inability to slow Mr. Biden’s rise in the polls. It’s also an illustration of his broader inability to shift the public conversation to another topic, something he has almost always been able to do when confronted with negative story lines ranging from impeachment proceedings to payouts to adult film stars. Mr. Trump is also restless. Administration officials said they were looking to resume his travel in as soon as a week, although campaign rallies remain distant for now. As they look for ways to regain the advantage, some Republicans believe the party must mount an immediate ad campaign blitzing Mr. Biden, identifying him to their advantage and framing the election as a clear choice. “If Trump is the issue, he probably loses,” said Mr. Black, the consultant. “If he makes it about Biden and the economy is getting better, he has a chance.”"
Reopening Has Begun. No One Is Sure What Happens Next.,"The economy shut down almost overnight. It won’t start back up that way.Politicians and public health experts have sparred for weeks over when, and under what circumstances, to allow businesses to reopen and Americans to emerge from their homes. But another question could prove just as thorny — how? Because the restart will be gradual, with certain places and industries opening earlier than others, it will by definition be complicated. The U.S. economy is a complex web of supply chains whose dynamics don’t necessarily align neatly with epidemiologists’ recommendations. Georgia and other states are beginning the reopening process. But even under the most optimistic estimates, it will be months, and possibly years, before Americans again crowd into bars and squeeze onto subway cars the way they did before the pandemic struck. “It’s going to take much longer to thaw the economy than it took to freeze it,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist for the accounting firm Grant Thornton. And it isn’t clear what, exactly, it means to gradually restart a system with as many interlocking pieces as the U.S. economy. How can one factory reopen when its suppliers remain shuttered? How can parents return to work when schools are still closed? How can older people return when there is still no effective treatment or vaccine? What is the government’s role in helping private businesses that may initially need to operate at a fraction of their normal capacity? South Carolina, for example, looks likely to be among the first states to allow widespread reopening of businesses. But if a manufacturer there depends on a part made in Ohio, where the virus is still spreading, it may not be able to resume production, regardless of the rules. “We live in an economy where there are lots of interconnections between different sectors,” said Joseph S. Vavra, an economist at the University of Chicago. “Saying you want to reopen gradually is more easily said than done.” The White House released a plan this month for a phased reopening of the economy, with restrictions easing as states meet public health benchmarks. States have begun to develop their own road maps. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said Tuesday that parts of the state that had fewer coronavirus cases might be allowed to reopen more quickly than New York City and other hard-hit areas. But those proposals are mostly rough schematics, leaving unanswered crucial questions about how the process will play out at the ground level. Those details may help determine whether the economy will bounce back relatively quickly once the pandemic ebbs or the United States will face a slow, painful turnaround, as it did after the last recession. Under the White House’s three-phase plan, many businesses will be allowed to open in the first phase. Schools and day care centers will need to wait for the next phase. That means that millions of working parents could be asked to return to their jobs before they have any way to take care of their children. Mr. Vavra and two colleagues recently estimated that nearly one-third of U.S. households have a child under 14, and that more than one in 10 has no other adult in the household to help with child care. In addition, many reopening plans call for younger adults to return to work first, while people over 55, who are at greater risk of severe complications or death, stay home longer to avoid exposure. But younger adults are also more likely to have young children at home. Then there is the public health threat: If states reopen their economies too quickly, or without the right precautions in place, that could lead to a renewed outbreak, with dire consequences for both safety and the economy. “The biggest risk is that you open too fast, too broadly, and you have another round of infections, a second wave,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics. “That’s the fodder for an economic depression. That would just completely undermine confidence.” Partial reopening may not work for everyone. In the early phases of reopening, businesses will almost certainly be required to operate at reduced capacity to allow for greater social distancing. That will require changes for virtually all companies, but in many cases it won’t present insurmountable hurdles. Offices, for example, might operate in rotating shifts, with different departments coming in on different days and deep cleanings performed in between. In factories, production lines could be redesigned to allow more distance between workers and to reduce or eliminate contact between teams. But other businesses could have a much harder time adapting. Most restaurants, for example, have tight profit margins even in the best of times. Operating at half capacity — or less — will mean losing money for many restaurants. “It’s impossible in the restaurant business to be profitable at a 50 percent revenue clip,” said Alex Smith, president of the Atlas Restaurant Group, which operates upscale establishments in Baltimore, Houston and other cities. For restaurants that were struggling before the shutdown, or that weren’t yet established enough to turn a profit, owners could decide that restocking kitchens and redesigning dining rooms to allow for social distancing is not worth the expense. “If you were profitable before and your business was growing, then you need to hold tight and hope that there’s light at the end of the tunnel and things will come back,” Mr. Smith said. But if you were losing money before, “you really have to ask yourself, are you digging a deeper hole?” Confidence is crucial. The public debate has focused on government mandates: When should city and state shutdown orders be lifted? But just because businesses are allowed to reopen doesn’t mean that they will or, if they do, that customers will return. Data from OpenTable, the restaurant reservation service, shows that people largely stopped eating out even before governors and mayors recommended doing so, and well before official shutdown orders took effect. Evidence from Sweden and other countries that have avoided formal lockdowns likewise shows that people have sharply reduced their activities even without government mandates. “I don’t think it was really the government shutdown orders that shut down the economy — I think it was the virus that shut down the economy,” Mr. Vavra said. “Saying the economy is now opened is just lip service. The economy’s not going to be reopened until people want it to reopen.” So far, there is little evidence that the public is ready. Despite scattered protests, surveys show widespread support for shutdown orders and little appetite for a rapid return. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that most Americans were more worried about lifting restrictions too early than keeping them in place too long. “There’s no restaurateur in the country that believes that when the government says ‘Go,’ the restaurants will be packed again,” Mr. Smith said. Mr. Smith’s greatest fear, he said, is that Americans will rush back to daily life too quickly, resulting in another flare-up and another lockdown. He can borrow money and reach into savings to reopen once, he said. A second time could be too much to manage, especially because a false start could leave customers even more wary. “What scares most of us is Wave 2,” he said.The government’s role isn’t finished.The federal government has already spent extraordinary amounts to keep individuals and businesses afloat during the economic shutdown. Congress approved another half-trillion-dollar aid package in recent days, with more help expected in coming weeks. But economists say the government’s role is only beginning. Businesses will need help weathering a period of reduced sales. State and local governments will need help, too, or they will have to cut programs to offset a sharp drop in tax revenue. Individuals will need unemployment benefits, food assistance and other aid to make ends meet in a recession that will almost certainly outlast the pandemic. The scope of those problems isn’t yet clear. No one knows how many businesses have failed permanently, rather than shut down temporarily, or how many laid-off workers will be able to return to their old jobs. But the longer the shutdown lasts, the more permanent the damage will be, and the slower the rebound. “You can press pause for a period of time, but not too long before that becomes bad loans and defaults and so on,” said Shubham Singhal, a senior partner at McKinsey, the consulting firm. “Then you have the negative cycle that feeds on itself for a while.” The good news is that the government mostly knows how to deal with that kind of problem. Unlike the current shutdown, which required policymakers to develop programs in record time, the post-pandemic period will probably resemble a more traditional recession and demand more conventional policy responses. The bad news is that, historically, political will for these programs has ended long before the need for them. After the last recession, calls to rein in jobless benefits began while the unemployment rate was still close to 10 percent. Elizabeth Ananat, a Barnard College economist who studies poverty and inequality, said she worried that government support would again dry up before the economy was ready to sustain itself, prolonging the downturn and hurting lower-income families, who are typically the last to benefit from a recovery. “In some ways, I’m even more anxious about the reopening than I am about the shutdown,” she said."
The Paramedics Couldn’t Find Lysol. They Turned to Their Congressman.,"WASHINGTON — The messages clog their offices’ phone lines and inboxes by the thousands, each a snapshot of someone’s lived nightmare — the wife whose husband is on a ventilator and getting worse by the day, the small-business owner who desperately needs a loan, the paramedic who wants disinfectant to clean his ambulance between shuttling the ill to the hospital. They are all punctuated by a flickering hope of a question: Could the congressman help?Assisting constituents in need has always been a critical part of the job of a member of Congress, but it has perhaps never been as important, or in demand, as it is now. As the coronavirus pandemic rips across the country, lawmakers have been inundated by messages from panicked and suffering Americans searching for a lifeline. Sidelined from their usual tasks on Capitol Hill, where Congress has been on an extended recess with only brief interruptions to approve huge infusions of federal funding to confront the public health and economic catastrophe, lawmakers are watching their jobs transform before their eyes. There is little for them to do in Washington — no hearings to attend, legislation to debate, or flesh-pressing at fund-raisers — but back home in their districts, they have become de facto case workers, and the needs are more than they can meet. “The last couple of weeks have fundamentally redefined what my job is, what it means to be a representative,” said Representative Andy Kim, Democrat of New Jersey, whose district, stretching across the eastern suburbs of Philadelphia to the Jersey Shore, has been hit hard by the virus. Mr. Kim has been so inundated — “literally hundreds of calls a day and hundreds more emails,” he said — that he has directed every aide in his office to pitch in, reorganizing them into teams dedicated to responding to a specific categories of questions. In the past few weeks, Mr. Kim said, more and more constituents have called in driven by fear and despair, often on the verge of tears. “You can tell they’re calling because they don’t know who else to come to,” he said. “When someone is calling our office about being scared to go outside because they don’t have a mask and they don’t know how to get one, they’re calling because they’re really worried.” Paul Daley, the director of emergency management in Toms River, N.J., said he contacted Mr. Kim’s office “more out of frustration than anything” when he reached out to say that his paramedics were out of the Lysol spray they urgently needed to sanitize their ambulances after transporting patients to the hospital. He was not expecting anything, but could the congressman help? Two days later, Mr. Kim’s office called back. They had located 78 cans of Lysol in a Walmart an hour and a half away in Pennsylvania — and had arranged for a team to hand-deliver the supplies to the fleet, based in Ocean County. “It’s like gold,” Mr. Daley said. But if the pandemic has exposed the vast array of needs that can land on lawmakers’ doorsteps, it has also made glaringly clear the limitations of their power. They cannot tell their constituents who are on the verge of closing a business when they can expect to receive an emergency loan. When one man who identified himself as Harvey called into a telephone town-hall-style event hosted by Representative Antonio Delgado, Democrat of New York, the congressman offered his assistance, but there was little advice Mr. Delgado could give to address the fact that the state’s unemployment website was crashing. “I have almost no faith it’s ever actually going to work,” Harvey told him.About 70 percent of the inquiries her office receives are “not even in our jurisdiction,” Representative Jahana Hayes, Democrat of Connecticut, estimated in an interview. But she said her constituents’ stories have kept her up at night. “It is extremely difficult for me to not have answers for constituents,” Ms. Hayes said. “We have had an endless stream of phone calls, emails and I don’t want to just respond to people with generic answers.” From his newly created home office — his kitchen — Representative Fred Upton, a Republican, takes the daily pulse of his southwestern Michigan district, reaching out to business owners and hearing from families in need of help. Mr. Upton has heard from the homeless shelter, where 300 people a night line up for blocks to get a free dinner, and from restaurant owners who are “losing their shirts.” One dentist, he said, reached out after an error in paperwork made it impossible for him to obtain the payroll loan he had been granted. By the time it was corrected, the program’s funds had run out. Now on the verge of bankruptcy, the dentist went to Mr. Upton for help. Hoping that congressional leaders in Washington would soon come to an agreement to replenish the program’s funds, Mr. Upton replied with a plea of his own: Could the dentist hold on for just two more weeks? “It’s hard,” Mr. Upton said, “because there are so many needs.”The sheer crush of requests offices have received has been overwhelming. Representative Kim Schrier, Democrat of Washington, a medical doctor whose district covers Seattle’s suburbs to the eastern side of the Cascade Mountains, said in an interview that her office had fielded over 13,000 emails and letters since the pandemic reached the United States, 8,000 of which her office has responded to in writing. Hundreds of others have required personal follow-up calls from Dr. Schrier and her staff. As more and more people in her district tested positive for the coronavirus, Dr. Schrier, a pediatrician, received “a lot of very detailed medical calls” from constituents seeking advice for how to navigate the crisis, like apple growers asking how to best protect their workers or grandparents wondering how to best protect the children in their charge. “My constituents are getting their news from a variety of sources — from some less scientifically based than others,” she said. “I really try to be a voice in the middle that can balance both the needs of the economy and public health, and how it shouldn’t be an either-or proposition.” Representative Rodney Davis, Republican of Illinois, who spent 16 years working in a district office before being elected to Congress, said many of his constituents had his cellphone number and were calling and texting him daily looking for answers about the relief programs created in the $2.2 trillion stimulus bill. “They’ve never worked through a government application process, they just need to know that their questions can be answered,” Mr. Davis said. “I think it just comes out of desperation. Most people don’t call their congressman even outside of a pandemic unless they’ve already really tried to get their case solved,” he added. “We’re really kind of a last resort.”Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting."
"Health Officials Responding to Coronavirus Lacked Proper Gear and Training, Investigation Finds","WASHINGTON — Federal health employees without adequate protective gear or training interacted with Americans quarantined at a military installation in California for possible exposure to the coronavirus, the top lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services concluded on Friday. The report validated the central claim of a government whistle-blower who raised concerns this year about the deployment of employees of the agency’s Administration for Children and Families who were dispatched in late January to help care for Americans repatriated from Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus outbreak there. The report found that proper procedures to protect the employees “temporarily broke down” amid a chaotic situation at March Air Reserve Base. But it rejected a second accusation of the same lapses at Travis Air Force Base, saying the procedures had been corrected in that instance. “In this unprecedented, dynamic, and evolving situation, the mission command and control structure during the March deployment temporarily broke down,” the general counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services wrote, according to a summary of the report obtained by The New York Times. The employees did not receive proper personal protective equipment, even as some of them touched evacuees, including upon their arrival, the report said. Other staff members were directed to remove their gear to avoid “bad optics,” according to multiple interviewees who spoke with lawyers with the Immediate Office of the General Counsel at the Department of Health and Human Services, which produced the report. “The investigation concluded that during the early days of what was an unprecedented repatriation of U.S. citizens from Wuhan, China, a rapidly evolving response meant that uniform infection-control and infection-prevention measures were not initially in place at March Air Reserve Base when repatriated Americans arrived on Jan. 29,” said Caitlin B. Oakley, a spokeswoman for the health department. Ms. Oakley noted that the investigation found that within 12 hours of the arrival, the department dispatched to the base a separate incident management team, which began providing guidance and prevention measures. “Anecdotal evidence” of breaches of protective equipment protocol at Travis Air Force Base were “the result of individual mistakes,” the report said, not a failure on the part of the agencies handling the effort. The report, which summed up the findings of a team of lawyers that interviewed 65 people and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents, offers some detail into how overwhelmed agencies were during initial federal response to the coronavirus. A separate review, conducted by the Office of the Inspector General, remains underway. None of the federal employees involved in the deployment at the March Air Reserve Base ultimately tested positive for the virus. A plane was on its way to Ontario Airport in California with American evacuees from Wuhan, the center of the coronavirus outbreak, in late January when federal officials decided that the proposed housing was medically inadequate and took over the repatriation from the State of California. The plane was rerouted to March Air Reserve Base, where federal officials scrambled to make arrangements for the evacuees, the report said. “The limited time that H.H.S. components had, as a result, to react led to failures,” the counsel’s office wrote in the summary. Without proper personal protective equipment, multiple federal health employees, including those with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, had to use equipment belonging to Riverside County, Calif. Within five days of first interacting with the evacuees on the air base, some of the workers traveled to Travis and other military facilities on commercial airlines. The lead official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the base, who was not named in the summary, repeatedly interacted closely with evacuees without proper protective equipment, according to multiple eyewitness accounts. The health workers also were not given clear infection-control and prevention guidance for dealing with the evacuees, the report said. When personnel asked for guidance, C.D.C. staff gave “confusing, incomplete and contradictory information,” and in some instances “set inconsistent examples with respect to their own personal use.”"
"Trump’s Temporary Halt to Immigration Is Part of Broader Plan, Stephen Miller Says","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s decision to suspend family-based immigration because of the coronavirus is the beginning of a broader strategy to reduce the flow of foreigners into the United States, Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump’s immigration agenda, told a group of conservative allies on Thursday. During a private conference call with the president’s supporters, Mr. Miller sought to reassure them of Mr. Trump’s commitment to their cause and urged them to publicly defend his executive order. He pledged that it was only a first step in the administration’s longer-term goal of shrinking legal immigration. “The first and most important thing is to turn off the faucet of new immigrant labor — mission accomplished — with signing that executive order,” Mr. Miller said, according to an audio recording of the conference call obtained by The New York Times. The executive order Mr. Trump signed this week bars people from receiving green cards for 60 days, a move that immigration advocates condemned. But it does nothing to limit visa programs that bring tens of thousands of workers to the United States, infuriating groups that call for deep reductions in the number of foreign citizens entering the country. Mr. Miller said that further restrictions on programs for foreign workers were likely.“In terms of dealing with some of these seasonal flows of guest workers and developing a strategy for that, that’s what the president directed us to do,” he said. The existence of the tape was first reported by The Washington Post. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump seized on fear of immigrants as a powerful political issue, and after winning the election, he aggressively pushed to shut down illegal crossings by demanding a “big, beautiful wall” between the United States and Mexico. In summer 2018, he separated migrant parents from their children when they crossed the border illegally, and sent the American military to fortify the border with Mexico. But immigration hard-liners have repeatedly urged the president to do more to permanently reduce the number of foreigners allowed to enter legally. Mr. Miller has made that a top priority in the last several years, pushing through regulatory changes aimed at shrinking the opportunities for foreigners to live and work in the United States. During the call, Mr. Miller said that the president’s executive order, while temporary, would have long-lasting effects because it would disrupt what conservatives call “chain migration,” in which the arrival of one immigrant in the United States opens the door to an extended family: parents, adult children, siblings and others. “When you suspend the entry of a new immigrant from abroad, you’re also reducing immigration further, because of the chains of follow-on migration that are disrupted,” Mr. Miller said. “So the benefit to American workers compounds with time.” Immigration is an issue that Mr. Trump has repeatedly turned to as a way to shore up his political base whenever his fortunes have appeared troubled. In late 2018, as polls predicted — accurately, it turned out — deep Republican losses in the midterm elections, the president pointed to what he claimed was an “invasion” by a caravan of immigrants who were heading toward the southwestern border. During Mr. Miller’s call, the acting deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, echoed Mr. Miller’s comments by saying the president has been considering such a step “since the economic effects of the Covid virus began.” Mr. Cuccinelli, a former Virginia attorney general who has long pushed for less immigration, told the president’s supporters on the call that “your best approach, in my view, is just to note this is a positive step — note the president has opened the door to more steps.” “You can certainly expect more actions from him as time goes forward,” Mr. Cuccinelli added.In response to a question from a caller about how to “message” the intent of the executive order, Mr. Cuccinelli said, “Talk about the fact that the president is taking steps, is taking this seriously, and has instructed us to prepare for other steps.” The issue of what to do about legal immigration has long divided Republicans, and many in the president’s party on Capitol Hill oppose proposals that would block businesses — including technology companies in Silicon Valley and big agricultural industries — from tapping into large pools of foreign labor. But others in the party, including Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, have repeatedly pushed for legislation that would reduce legal immigration. In 2017, Mr. Trump endorsed the RAISE Act, a bill that Mr. Cotton sponsored that would have cut legal immigration each year by about half, from about one million to about 500,000. The legislation ultimately went nowhere. While Mr. Trump has often used immigration as a tool to rally his base, he has not been consistent in his approach. The administration is facing a potential inflection point when the Supreme Court rules in the next few months on whether the administration’s end of the program that protects undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, known as DACA, was done legally. If the administration’s decision is upheld, Mr. Trump will face the possibility of deporting hundreds of thousands of immigrants, many of whom are in high school or college and have known no other life, while he is in the middle of a re-election battle. On a recent call with Republican senators, Mr. Trump told the group that he would not “leave them hanging,” in reference to immigrants affected by the decision, but he said nothing further. It is unclear exactly how the executive order that temporarily halted immigration was drafted. Two officials familiar with the discussions said that Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser who has taken on a bigger role in immigration discussions, was left out of the process of developing the order. Officials said that the order was initially meant to be broader, putting what the president called “a pause” on both family-based immigration and the guest worker programs that are important to business groups. But on Tuesday, after the president tweeted about the executive order the previous night — which caught several advisers by surprise — the White House faced fierce criticism from corporate executives, farmers and others who rely on temporary guest workers. Mr. Kushner told the president that he should consider alternatives to the strict measures that were under discussion, according to the officials with knowledge of the discussions."
Biden Steps Up Warnings of Possible Trump Disruption of Election,"For months, Joseph R. Biden Jr. has argued that under pressure and political duress, President Trump may pursue increasingly extreme measures to stay in power. In November, Mr. Biden said he feared that “as the walls close in on him he becomes more erratic. And I’m genuinely concerned about what he may do in order to try to hold on to the office.” In January, Mr. Biden fretted: “He still has another nine or 10 months. God knows what can happen.”And on Thursday, he added some urgency to his warnings, suggesting that Mr. Trump might try to delay or otherwise disrupt the election. “Mark my words, I think he is going to try to kick back the election somehow, come up with some rationale why it can’t be held,” Mr. Biden said at a fund-raiser, according to a news media pool report. Mr. Trump, he suggested, is “trying to let the word out that he’s going to do all he can to make it very hard for people to vote. That’s the only way he thinks he can possibly win.” It was an extraordinary claim for the presumptive Democratic nominee to make about an opponent, especially for Mr. Biden, a former vice president and Washington veteran who prides himself on civility and respect for American institutions, including and especially the presidency. But as early polls show that Mr. Trump is vulnerable in several key battleground states, and as the president dispenses conflicting and often misleading information at his daily briefings on the coronavirus, Mr. Biden’s remarks amounted to a warning shot that attempts to frame for the public — to his advantage — what may be the ugliest election in recent American history. “It very much is reflecting the fear that a lot of people have about how President Trump is going to respond later in the year to this election, especially if he continues to see his polls drop, and if he continues to flail and lash out,” said Chuck Hagel, who served as defense secretary in the Obama administration and before that as a Republican senator from Nebraska, and who hosted Mr. Biden at a fund-raiser this month. Mr. Hagel said he had heard widespread concerns “about what President Trump may pull, especially if he sees he’s losing.” Mr. Trump has not moved to delay the election, and Mr. Biden, who once taught constitutional law, most likely knows as well as the voting experts do that it would be exceedingly difficult to postpone the election and that the president does not have the authority to unilaterally take such action. Mr. Biden’s campaign declined to comment further on his comments from Thursday night.Mr. Biden’s escalating remarks about Mr. Trump’s approach to the election come as a number of polls have shown that many Americans disapprove of the president’s stewardship of the crisis, and that he badly trails the nation’s governors and his own medical experts in terms of whom Americans trust most for guidance. Mr. Biden is a passionate critic of Mr. Trump’s character, and his latest remarks appeared to be another effort to convince voters that the president is desperate for victory at any cost. Of course, character attacks on Mr. Trump are not enough to win the presidency — in 2016, Hillary Clinton and her campaign spent months lashing Mr. Trump’s integrity to no avail. Mr. Biden is also aware of the need for a broader, more tangible message this cycle, especially at a moment of economic disaster for many Americans. And despite the current health and financial problems facing the nation, Republicans say there is still time for Mr. Trump to push a recovery narrative before November. Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign dismissed Mr. Biden’s election comments on Friday. “Those are the incoherent, conspiracy theory ramblings of a lost candidate who is out of touch with reality,” Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign, said in a statement. And a Republican National Committee spokesman, Steve Guest, called Mr. Biden’s comments “an irresponsible allegation,” adding that “President Trump has made it clear that the general election will happen on November 3rd.” Mr. Biden has repeatedly pointed out that America has voted through crises including the Civil War and World War II, and has been adamant that the nation will hold an election this November, too. As the coronavirus outbreak unfolded this spring, forcing many states to postpone their presidential primaries, Mr. Biden routinely and vehemently dismissed the prospect of a delayed presidential election as “out of the question.” “I know there’s a lot of rumors and speculation as to, ‘is the other guy going to try to postpone the election in November’ and all that,” Mr. Biden said at a fund-raiser last month. “There’s no need to do that.” Mr. Biden has also signaled that he is acutely aware of the roadblocks to voting that Americans may face as an election unfolds amid a pandemic — and has sought to call attention to those challenges early. “It’s a wake-up call, so the American people can understand the depths to which this president will go to maintain power,” said Representative Cedric Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and a co-chairman of Mr. Biden’s campaign, when asked about Mr. Biden’s suggestion that Mr. Trump would try to delay the election. “And there’s a need to prepare.” Mr. Trump has inaccurately claimed that voting by mail is closely associated with fraud. He has bashed the United States Postal Service. (“And why is that? Because he is already trying to undermine the election with false claims of voter fraud,” Mr. Biden said on Thursday, according to the pool report, as he detailed a suite of proposals to bolster voting protection.) Russia did interfere in the American election in 2016, something Mr. Biden suggested on Thursday would be repeated — “I guarantee you they are doing it again with two other major actors,” he said, without naming those actors. And Jon Meacham, an author and historian whom Mr. Biden respects, wrote in a New York Times Op-Ed recently about “the possibility that President Trump might take advantage of the unfolding health crisis to delay the November election. Alarmist? Not for anyone who’s paid even glancing attention to the president’s will to power and contempt for constitutional convention.” Taken together, there is a real concern among many Democrats that Mr. Trump, who recently claimed “total” authority as president during the crisis before ceding some authority to the governors, will pursue re-election ruthlessly and with no regard for traditional norms. “He thinks that all the power is in the presidency, and so I think it’s a very valid concern,” Mr. Richmond said. David Pepper, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, still expects the election next fall, stressing that there are constitutional guardrails protecting the contest. But in his presidential battleground state, Mr. Pepper said, Democrats are deeply concerned by the president’s criticisms of voting by mail — a practice defended by the state’s Republican governor. Mr. Pepper said he agreed with Mr. Biden that “Trump, I think, will be tempted to do pretty much anything if he feels he might lose.” "
Durham Inquiry Includes Scrutiny of a Media Leak,"WASHINGTON — For years, President Trump has complained bitterly about F.B.I. officials who investigated his campaign’s ties to Russia, and about the “rogue bureaucrats of the Deep State” at the intelligence agencies, portraying them as enemies out to delegitimize his presidency. Now, a special Justice Department inquiry investigating those officials has taken on another of Mr. Trump’s irritants: leaks to the news media. Investigators for John H. Durham, the U.S. attorney in Connecticut leading the investigation, have asked witnesses about news articles published in early 2017 that former administration officials blame for prompting the chaos that dominated the early days of the Trump presidency, according to three people familiar with the inquiry. Among them was a Washington Post column about Michael T. Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, one of the people said. What Mr. Durham has found is hidden from public view, and the coronavirus pandemic has slowed his progress, the people said. But Attorney General William P. Barr has promoted the investigation in recent days, saying that Mr. Durham has uncovered “troubling” problems and indicating that some results could made public before the general election in November. Mr. Trump has said he looks forward to the outcome of the inquiry, and a report or criminal charges before the election would all but assure that he weaponize it for political gain. The new details show that Mr. Durham’s inquiry is broader than previously known — not just examining intelligence on Russia and how it was handled or investigative decisions by the F.B.I., but whether sources spoke to The Post intending to damage Mr. Trump’s presidency. The president and his allies in Congress have long condemned leaks revealing unflattering information about the administration. Mr. Durham declined to comment, a spokesman said, as did a spokeswoman for the Justice Department.Mr. Durham was initially assigned to examine the origins of the F.B.I. investigation into whether any Trump associates conspired with Russia’s interference in 2016 to tilt the election. Since then, his team has not only questioned F.B.I. officials but also intelligence analysts, suggesting that he was taking aim at the spy agencies’ most explosive conclusion about 2016: that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intervened to benefit Mr. Trump. Investigators have also examined the role of John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director in 2016, in how intelligence agencies assessed Russia’s election interference. Though Mr. Trump’s allies have accused Mr. Brennan — who has made his distaste for the president widely known — of tainting intelligence to go after Mr. Trump, the Senate Intelligence Committee said this week in a report that it found no evidence that the intelligence community’s assessment on Russian interference had been politicized. Last year, Mr. Durham also started examining the 2017 column by The Post’s David Ignatius, said a person familiar with that line questioning. Mr. Ignatius revealed that Mr. Flynn had spoken in late 2016 with Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States at the time, as the Obama administration was about to place sanctions on Russia for its election sabotage. Mr. Ignatius noted Mr. Flynn’s close contacts with the Russians and suggested that because Mr. Flynn was apparently conducting foreign policy while another administration was in power, he might have violated the Logan Act. The law is an obscure statute that bars private citizens from interfering with diplomatic relations between the United States and foreign governments and is widely considered to be essentially defunct. The next month, Mr. Flynn resigned after lying to the vice president and other White House officials about the call with Mr. Kislyak. He eventually pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about the nature of his discussions with Mr. Kislyak but later backtracked, asking a federal judge to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea. Mr. Flynn’s lawyer, Sidney Powell, has repeatedly accused prosecutors of hiding exculpatory evidence, claims that the judge has rejected. On Friday, federal prosecutors turned over documents in the case that she described on Twitter as “remarkable new & long withheld” evidence, and a person briefed on them said that the documents indicated that F.B.I. agents did not follow standard procedures as they investigated Mr. Flynn. Prosecutors said the materials were reports related to the Flynn investigation along with communications and notes by F.B.I. agents assigned to it. Ms. Powell said they should have been shared with her client’s legal team at the outset of his prosecution and asked the judge to unseal them. Mr. Ignatius’s column “set off a chain of events that helped lead to the Russia probe,” K.T. McFarland, the former deputy national security adviser to Mr. Trump, wrote in her recent book, “Revolution: Trump, Washington and ‘We the People.’” Mr. Durham has reviewed Ms. McFarland’s interviews with F.B.I. investigators in other inquiries, examining what she has said about Mr. Ignatius’s reporting and asked other witnesses about it, according to person familiar with elements of the investigation. She revised her answers to questions from investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, on elements of Mr. Flynn’s talks with Mr. Kislyak but has accused the investigators of trying to ensnare her in “perjury trap.” Mr. Durham has not questioned Ms. McFarland.Whether Mr. Durham has taken over an existing leak investigation of the Ignatius column opened in 2017 or is doing a parallel review as part of his larger inquiry remains unclear. Since the special counsel’s investigation ended, prosecutors in the U.S. attorney’s office in the District of Columbia have overseen matters related to Mr. Flynn. It was not clear whether Mr. Durham was investigating any other leaks.While Mr. Durham has said little publicly about the investigation, Mr. Barr has been more vocal. He has repeatedly made clear that he believes that the F.B.I. should have never opened its Trump-Russia investigation, contradicting a finding by the Justice Department inspector general that law enforcement officials had sufficient reason to begin the inquiry. The inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, also documented serious errors in the process to seek court approval for a wiretap on a former Trump adviser, Carter Page, whom investigators suspected of being an agent of Russia. An F.B.I. lawyer has been accused of altering an email as part of the application process and could face prosecution. Mr. Barr has said that Mr. Durham found problems with the investigation that go beyond the applications for the Page wiretap, a small aspect of the sprawling Russia inquiry. “The evidence shows that we are not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness,” Mr. Barr told the Fox News host Laura Ingraham this month. “There is something far more troubling here. And we’re going to get to the bottom of it. And if people broke the law and we can establish that with the evidence, they will be prosecuted.” The attorney general’s comments about the investigation have troubled defense lawyers who believe that Mr. Barr is tainting Mr. Durham’s work by talking about the inquiry before it is concluded. Some of the lawyers privately questioned whether they would let Mr. Durham or his investigators interview their clients without a subpoena because of Mr. Barr’s comments. The attorney general has brushed aside concerns about publicly revealing the results of a potentially politically explosive investigation close to an election, raising the prospect that Mr. Durham’s results could be made public before the presidential election. Justice Department policies prohibit law enforcement officials from taking investigative steps or filing criminal charges to affect elections. Mr. Barr said that those rules do not apply to the Durham inquiry because none of his targets are running for president or are closely associated with the presidential candidates. “The idea is you don’t go after candidates, you don’t indict candidates, or perhaps someone that’s officially close to a candidate — that is essentially the same — within a certain number of days before an election,” Mr. Barr told the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt this week. “But, you know, as I say, I don’t think any of the people whose actions are under review by Durham fall into that category.” Mr. Barr’s actions have hamstrung prosecutors before. An investigation into the former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew G. McCabe fell apart in part because of prosecutors’ concerns that Mr. Barr’s handling of the special counsel report would make their case look even more politicized in addition to the president’s attacks on an accomplished former top law enforcement official, people familiar with that inquiry have said. The attorney general decided to pronounce Mr. Trump cleared of obstruction of justice in 2019 after the Mueller report put forward evidence that Mr. Trump had committed that crime but stopped short of rendering any prosecutorial judgment. Mr. Barr’s decision prompted swift condemnation that he was going beyond his role to help Mr. Trump politically and putting the department’s typical independence in jeopardy. Mr. Durham is relying on a team of prosecutors, including Nora R. Dannehy and Neeraj Patel, from Connecticut, as well as former and current F.B.I. agents to complete his investigation. Anthony Scarpelli, a top prosecutor from the U.S. attorney’s office in Washington, was detailed to the team along with a federal prosecutor from Manhattan, Andrew DeFilippis. Two former F.B.I. agents, Timothy Fuhrman and Jack Eckenrode, are also assisting. An F.B.I. agent who oversaw public corruption in Chicago and served in Ukraine as an assistant legal attaché, Peter Angelini, has also joined Mr. Durham’s team.Charlie Savage and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting."
"Henry Geller, Who Helped Rid TV of Cigarette Ads, Dies at 96","John F. Banzhaf III was watching football on television with his family in the Bronx on Thanksgiving 1966 when he realized that the most strategic plays were being made off the field — in the cigarette commercials whose jingles, gags, slogans and images of virile cowboys and urbane women glamorized smoking. Two years had elapsed since the United States surgeon general declared that smoking caused lung cancer. But while Congress had voted to require health warning labels on cigarette packaging, it had, for the time being, not required them for TV commercials. Mr. Banzhaf, a 25-year-old recent graduate of Columbia Law School, complained in a letter to the Federal Communications Commission that while television news coverage included both sides of the tobacco debate, the cigarette commercials did not. Under the so-called fairness doctrine, which required that both sides of an issue of public concern be presented, weren’t opponents of smoking entitled to free airtime? “When his letter came in, it struck a responsive chord, and I thought why not use it?” Henry Geller, the F.C.C. counsel at the time, recalled in an unpublished memoir. Mr. Geller, who died on April 7 in Washington at 96, did just that. He suggested that one antismoking public service message be broadcast free for every paid cigarette advertisement. That proposed formula so unnerved station owners afraid of jeopardizing their licenses, and tobacco companies concerned about competing with powerful antismoking commercials, that Congress was finally able to ban the advertising altogether. “The industry desperately wanted to stop these counter ads and did so by eliminating its own ads,” Mr. Geller said. “From April 1, 1970, forward, all cigarette advertising was eliminated from radio and television.” In effect, Mr. Banzhaf said this week, “Geller fortuitously made new federal law in a most unusual manner, and probably helped to save millions of lives.” (Mr. Banzhaf became a professor at George Washington University Law School and a litigious defender of public health, challenging cigarette, fast food and soft drink firms.) Mr. Geller later profoundly influenced American politics by successfully challenging the equal time doctrine as a private citizen, a challenge that led to a ruling allowing for televised debates between the major presidential candidates. Such debates have been held in every presidential election since 1976. In 1960, the networks had been granted a special dispensation by Congress to broadcast the groundbreaking face-off between Senator John F. Kennedy and Vice President Richard M. Nixon. Under the original doctrine, a dozen or so minor party candidates would have been entitled to participate in the debates. After no televised debates were held in 1964, 1968 and 1972, Mr. Geller persuaded the commission that broadcasting debates was the equivalent of covering any other breaking news event, and was therefore exempt from that requirement. Mr. Geller was also instrumental in expanding the channels available to new cable subscribers in 1970, while he was still at the F.C.C. The commission voted to allow the cable industry to import distant television signals and distribute them to its customers. It also required the industry both to subsidize educational programming and to compensate local broadcasters. Unlike many of his colleagues in government, Mr. Geller never capitalized on his public service to get a high-paying job in the private sector. He worked for the RAND Corporation, the Aspen Institute and, from 1980 to 1991, Duke University’s Washington Center for Public Policy Research. As its director he helped draft and successfully lobby for federal legislation that imposed limits on how much advertising was allowed on children’s programming. Henry Geller was born on Feb. 14, 1924, in Springfield, Mass., to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. His father, Samuel, was a homebuilder. His mother, Sadie (Kramer) Geller, was a homemaker. He grew up in Detroit, graduated from the University of Michigan at 19 in 1943 with a degree in chemistry, and then served with the Army in the Pacific during World War II. When he returned, he began graduate study in chemistry at Michigan. But, he later recalled, when he encountered several law school students and learned that they rarely studied, he enrolled in Northwestern University School of Law. “I thought Henry was the smartest guy in law school,” Newton N. Minow, who was a year behind him at Northwestern and who later became F.C.C. chairman, told Broadcast magazine in 1979. “He was a movie nut. He’d go to three movies a day and never hit the books until a week before exams.” Mr. Geller graduated second in his class in 1949, went to work for the F.C.C. and then for the National Labor Relations Board, and clerked for an Illinois state judge. In 1955 he married Judy Foelak, who ran a speakers’ bureau. She survives him and confirmed his death, from complications of bladder cancer, at their home in Washington. He is also survived by their children, Peter Geller and Kathryn Edwards, and a grandson. Mr. Geller was the F.C.C.’s general counsel from 1964 to 1970 and a special assistant to the chairman until 1973. From 1978 to 1980, he was the first administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. He remained current on evolving technology; not long ago he said he was trying to figure out how to persuade Congress to mandate attribution for online political advertising. A rumpled man with a preference for sneakers and jeans, Mr. Geller played tennis into his 90s, taught himself quantum physics and could argue a complex case without a single note. He preferred movies to television; borrowing from Frank Lloyd Wright, he referred to TV as “chewing gum for the eyes.” And when he did tune in, he usually confined himself to nature documentaries or quirky British comedy like “Monty Python’s Flying Circus.” Mr. Geller was that rare former public official who could not only laugh at himself but also admit a mistake — like when he advised Mr. Minow, the newly installed F.C.C. chairman, against using what would become Mr. Minow’s signature phrase. In a scathing speech to the National Association of Broadcasters in 1961, Mr. Minow praised good television but challenged broadcast executives to spend a full day in front of their sets without any distraction. “What you will observe,” he said, “is a vast wasteland.” “I told him not to say it,” Mr. Geller recalled in an oral history interview for the Fordham University Libraries in 2010. “I said, ‘You have every right to say they’re not delivering public service, but you shouldn’t go around on the quality of programs.’ The government can’t do quality. It’s subjective. It violates the First Amendment.” “He laughs now,” Mr. Geller continued, “and he always introduces me saying, ‘This is the man who told me not to say vast wasteland.’”"
Navy Leaders Recommend Reinstating Roosevelt Captain Fired Over Virus Warning,"WASHINGTON — Capt. Brett E. Crozier should be restored to command of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, the Navy’s top officials recommended on Friday. But Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, who was briefed on the recommendations, has asked for more time to consider whether to sign off on reinstating the captain of the nuclear-powered carrier. Mr. Esper received the recommendation from the chief of naval operations, Adm. Michael M. Gilday, and the acting Navy secretary, James McPherson. Defense Department officials said earlier that they expected to announce the results of the Navy’s investigation into the matter on Friday afternoon. Mr. Esper’s decision to hold up the investigation has surprised Navy officials, who believed that the defense secretary would leave the process in the hands of the military chain of command. A reinstatement of Captain Crozier would be a stunning turnaround in a story that has seized the attention of the Navy, the overall military and even a nation grappling with the coronavirus. From the moment that his letter pleading for help from Navy officials first became public, Captain Crozier has taken on the role of an unlikely hero, willing to risk his career for the sake of his sailors. After he was fired by a political appointee of President Trump, the saga took on new meaning. A video of hundreds of cheering sailors yelling “Captain Crozier!” as he departed the aircraft carrier, black backpack on his shoulder, went viral. The maneuverings afterward of the acting Navy secretary at the time, Thomas B. Modly, to right a crisis in the Navy only deepened public interest. Now, after a review of the episodes of the last month, it is Mr. Modly who is out of his job. Meanwhile, Admiral Gilday and Mr. Modly’s successor, Mr. McPherson, pushed for the reinstatement of Captain Crozier during a meeting on Friday with Mr. Esper. “Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Mike Gilday has presented recommendations to the acting secretary of the Navy, James McPherson,” the Navy said in a statement on Friday. “Secretary McPherson is continuing discussions with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper. No final decisions have been made.” Admiral Gilday and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had both advised Mr. Modly not to remove Captain Crozier before an investigation into events aboard the Roosevelt was complete. But Mr. Modly feared that Mr. Trump wanted Captain Crozier fired, according to his acquaintances, and dismissed the captain. But the president’s position softened as videos of crew members extolling their captain made their way around social media. Still, it was unclear exactly where the president now stands on the reinstatement of Captain Crozier, and Mr. Esper’s decision not to immediately accept the recommendation that the captain be reinstated could reflect a fear of getting on the wrong side of his boss, officials said. Admiral Gilday and James McPherson, the acting Navy secretary who succeeded Mr. Modly after he resigned, reached agreement late last week that the events leading to Captain Crozier’s letter pleading for help showed that he should not have been removed, officials said. They briefed General Milley on their findings on Tuesday. It was unclear late Friday why the defense secretary had delayed the process. His spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, had said earlier in the day that Mr. Esper was likely to back the Navy’s conclusion. Subsequently on Friday, Mr. Hoffman issued a statement that “after the secretary receives a written copy of the completed inquiry, he intends to thoroughly review the report and will meet again with Navy leadership to discuss next steps.” Mr. Esper is usually closely aligned with Mr. Trump, and may want to make sure that the president will not reverse the process, as he did last year when he ordered the Navy not to punish a member of the Navy SEALs whose case had caught his attention. Captain Crozier, who friends say is feeling better after he himself contracted the coronavirus, is in isolation in the distinguished visitors quarter on a Navy base in Guam. He is awaiting another test to confirm that he no longer has the virus, his friend said. Representative Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat who leads the House Armed Services Committee, issued a statement on Friday calling for the captain to be reinstated. “While Captain Crozier’s actions at the outset of the health crisis aboard the T.R. were drastic and imperfect, it is clear he only took such steps to protect his crew,” he said. “Captain Crozier should be reinstated to his command immediately.” Former Navy leaders echoed that sentiment. “The Navy leadership made the right call and Secretary Esper needs to support it,” said Sean O’Keefe, who was Navy secretary under President George Bush. “Captain Crozier made a decision to place his crew above himself and that’s a noble precedent.” On April 2, when Captain Crozier walked off the gangway of the Roosevelt in Guam, where the ship is docked, some 114 Roosevelt sailors had tested positive for the coronavirus. Now, a little over three weeks later, that number stands at 856, or 17 percent of a crew of just under 5,000. On Thursday, the Navy said that it had completed testing on all 4,938 crew members. Of the total cases, 88 sailors have recovered and 4,234 have moved ashore, the Navy said. Four sailors are in the hospital with the disease. The “core crew,” those left behind on the Roosevelt to clean and prepare the ship for those on Guam, is set to be swapped out by the end of the month. The Roosevelt is then expected to undertake sea trials, allowing the fighter-jet wing aboard to requalify for aircraft carrier landings at sea before continuing on its deployment. But that plan has run into its own set of complications, as some of those crew members, housed in local hotels and believed to have not contracted the virus, have tested positive in recent days. A lack of space for these patients has prompted some of the crew to be moved into a warehouse on the naval base in what health care providers have deemed the “sailor shuffle.” And on Friday, Pentagon officials said a crew member aboard the Kidd, a destroyer deployed to the Caribbean, had tested positive for the virus, marking the second time a deployed Navy ship had been stricken with the illness. In a subsequent statement, the Navy said that at least 17 other sailors had also tested positive.John Ismay contributed reporting."
He Got Off the Table After Cancer Surgery to Take On the Virus,"Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey arrives for his daily media briefings by himself. Clad in a mask, he keeps space between those who walk in before him and sits well beyond the six feet recommended for social distancing. It may seem like leadership by example, but for Mr. Murphy, it is also a matter of personal survival. It has been seven weeks since news of New Jersey’s first confirmed coronavirus case was delivered to Mr. Murphy while he was on an operating table, about to have a cancerous piece of his kidney removed. A restful recovery would not be an option.Since then, 5,617 in the state have died from the virus and 102,196 have been infected. The rapid spread of the coronavirus has forced governors across the country to confront unknowable and seemingly impossible challenges, and few have been more acutely challenged than Mr. Murphy. Beyond the governor’s personal health concerns, New Jersey has been ravaged by the outbreak, and is second only to New York in both number of cases and deaths, despite ranking 11th in population among the 50 states. Nursing homes in particular, filled with vulnerable populations and where social distancing between residents and workers is nearly impossible, have been calamitous petri dishes for the disease, and Mr. Murphy has acknowledged the state’s struggle to meet these challenges. And as the public health crisis appears to be ebbing, some elected officials and top Republicans say Mr. Murphy, who issued his stay-at-home order on March 21, needs to be clearer about how and when he is going to reopen the state. “It’s important for the governor to convey some sense of hope,” said Jack Ciattarelli, a former Republican state lawmaker and a candidate for governor in 2021. “People are bristling over the lack of discussion as to possibly when and how we relaunch our state economy.” Jon M. Bramnick, the Republican leader in the Assembly, said Mr. Murphy had been “somewhat resistant” to discussing ending the shutdown. Still, even his political foes have largely rallied around Mr. Murphy who, as a first-term governor seeking to steady a state that has become an epicenter of the outbreak, has emerged as a different type of Democratic voice. His briefings — never commanding the limelight that his neighbor, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, has attracted — are emblematic of his governing style: deferential yet stoic, present but not overbearing, not likely to draw or seek the spotlight. The governor’s briefings often stretch beyond 90 minutes or until reporters run out of questions.Mr. Murphy, 62, doesn’t display Mr. Cuomo’s brashness — his harshest lashings have been to label those flouting stay-at-home orders as “knuckleheads.” And unlike Democratic governors like Mr. Cuomo or Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Mr. Murphy has often refrained from criticizing President Trump, focusing instead on offering the public gratitude that Mr. Trump often seeks. “I don’t wake up in the morning with the luxury of picking who my president is that day,” Mr. Murphy said in an interview. “We need all the help we can get from them, and so that doesn’t mean we’re going to pull our punches.” Mr. Murphy has spoken directly to Mr. Trump about half a dozen times, and the president has publicly praised the governor. “Governor Murphy of New Jersey is a terrific guy and, frankly, he wants — you know, he’s got a pretty hot spot right there,” Mr. Trump said last month. New Jersey has received 1,050 ventilators from the national stockpile Mr. Trump controls, three field medical stations with 1,000 beds, two Federal Emergency Management Agency field-testing sites and 1.5 million pieces of personal protective equipment, though Mr. Murphy said the state still needed federal help to expand its testing capacity. “I think his style is well suited to this,” said Heather H. Howard, a professor at Princeton University who served as the chief policy counsel to Jon S. Corzine, the former New Jersey governor. “New Jersey, my sense is, is ready for the steady hand that he provides. It’s not dramatic, but it’s data-driven and thoughtful.” But even as the death toll and amount of cases climb, Mr. Murphy has clung to evidence, like the declining number of people on ventilators, that the state may be emerging from the worst of the crisis. Still, the coronavirus continues to stalk nursing homes — more than 40 percent of the state’s deaths have come from long-term-care facilities. Many families of victims said they were never told that the virus had been spreading. To protect patients, the state Department of Health banned nonmedical visitors on March 16. But Mr. Murphy’s administration, citing privacy concerns, resisted publicly sharing the number of deaths and cases at individual homes, relenting only recently. The governor has criticized some of the facilities — he called the deaths of at least 70 people at a nursing home in Andover “not just outrageous, but unacceptable” — while also cautioning about difficulty of protecting long-term-care residences. “We knew this was going to be a challenge,” Mr. Murphy said. “I have to say, I don’t think in America, let alone in New Jersey, we knew the extent of that challenge.” For much of his first three years as governor, Mr. Murphy has rarely captured public attention like his Republican predecessor, Chris Christie. His folksy, aw-shucks exuberance never quite resonated with the blunt Jersey attitude, and his relentless pursuit of progressive policies sowed deep divisions with more moderate leaders from his own party. Even as he neared the halfway point in office, about 20 percent of state voters still had not formed an opinion about his leadership. Now his daily briefings attract thousands of viewers on YouTube, and a recent Monmouth University poll found that 71 percent of voters approved of his job as governor — a level of support that nears Mr. Christie’s popularity after Hurricane Sandy rolled over New Jersey. Even some decisions that have provoked criticism, such as his decision to close state and county parks while neighboring states did not, are widely supported in the state. (Roughly 70 percent of voters favor the park closures.) Facing shortages of nearly every needed resource to fight the virus, Mr. Murphy has had to get creative. New Jersey recently became the first state to begin issuing temporary licenses to allow foreign-licensed doctors to practice. In March, he ordered nonmedical facilities to conduct an inventory of personal protective equipment, and this month he directed the State Police to confiscate what was needed. He sends hundreds of texts a day, with at least one of his two phones constantly connected to a charger, triaging requests from hospital executives with pleas to the White House for more equipment. “When I tested positive, I was getting text messages and calls two to three times a day, both asking about me and what can he do to help,” said Michael Maron, the president and chief executive of Holy Name Medical Center, a hospital in Bergen County that was besieged by coronavirus cases. Mr. Murphy has faced steeper hurdles when it comes to testing.As late as mid-March, the state had only two test kits from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which were capable of testing less than 500 people total. Pleas for more testing were rebuffed, even as the outbreak was growing in northern New Jersey. And not until recently were state health officials keeping track of tests performed by commercial labs. Though testing has picked up in New Jersey, it is still hindered by bottlenecks, like overloaded labs, a lack of materials and the need to occasionally fly tests to other states. Mr. Murphy and other health officials have said that widespread testing is crucial to easing stay-at-home orders. ”The country was completely unprepared as it relates to testing,” he said, while extolling what New Jersey has done. “We’ve gone from zero to 70 sites.” Though his style may differ, Mr. Murphy has often been in sync with Mr. Cuomo about keeping their states under lockdown. The two communicate frequently, with Mr. Murphy’s declarations of new regulations often coming hours after New York’s governor. But like Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Murphy has been criticized for not moving quickly enough to shut down New Jersey. Mr. Murphy issued a stay-at-home order on March 21, when there were 1,327 cases; New Jersey was the fourth state to make such a declaration. But California had issued its order two days earlier with half the number of cases. ”One could have argued that it should have been done earlier, because if it was done earlier it would have had more of an impact,” said Brian Strom, the chancellor of Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences. But, Mr. Strom said, it was a difficult decision because federal guidelines were not calling for a complete shutdown and neighboring states were not taking similar steps. “Could you really expect a New Jersey or New York to say we’re going to shutdown our economy when no one else is?” he said. “We’re shutting our schools when everyone else is open?” Mr. Murphy said he calibrated the shutdown with the role that institutions play in providing a social safety net. Schools, for example, needed to be able to deliver distance learning to children who lack access to the internet or the necessary devices. “For kids who rely on their schools for their only hot meal or remote-learning concerns,” Mr. Murphy said, “I was prepared to let that go a couple of days to make sure the plan was the right one.” As his briefings have grown more grim — with daily deaths in the hundreds — Mr. Murphy has began sharing the life stories of a handful of those who have died. There was Margit Feldman, 90, a Holocaust survivor; Richard Campbell, a 28-year veteran firefighter and chief of the Edison Fire Department; and Darrell Johnson, 43, who worked at Morristown High School. Mr. Murphy began these daily tributes on March 30, hoping they would bring some solace to those who could not grieve together. “I call somewhere between, probably, plus or minus a half a dozen families a day and just talk to them,” the governor said. “And the part that really sucks for these families, in addition that they lost somebody, is they can’t have a normal farewell. They can’t have a wake or a funeral. And I think it came out of that, to say, you know what, at least for a handful of people each day, let’s put them up in lights.”"
"Trump Speech to Bring 1,000 West Point Cadets Back to Campus","WASHINGTON — For President Trump, who adores the pomp and precision of military ceremonies, this was the year he would finally get one of the special perks of being president — delivering the commencement address at West Point, the only service academy where he has not spoken. But the graduation was postponed because of the coronavirus, the cadets were sent home and officials at the school were not sure when it would be held or even whether it was a good idea to hold it. The Naval Academy, for its part, decided it was too risky to recall its nearly 1,000 graduating midshipmen to Annapolis, Md., for a commencement. Those graduates will have a virtual event. But the Air Force Academy, in contrast to the other schools, sent home its underclassmen, locked down its seniors on campus, moved up graduation, mandated social distancing — and went ahead with plans for Vice President Mike Pence to be its speaker. And so last Friday, the day before Mr. Pence was to speak at the Air Force ceremony in Colorado, Mr. Trump, never one to be upstaged, abruptly announced that he would, in fact, be speaking at West Point. That was news to everyone, including officials at West Point, according to three people involved with or briefed on the event. The academy had been looking at the option of a delayed presidential commencement in June, but had yet to complete any plans. With Mr. Trump’s pre-emptive statement, they are now summoning 1,000 cadets scattered across the country to return to campus in New York, the state that is the center of the outbreak. “He’s the commander in chief, that’s his call,” said Sue Fulton, a West Point graduate and former chairwoman of the academy’s Board of Visitors. “Cadets are certainly excited about the opportunity to have something like the classic graduation, standing together, flinging their hats in the air. “But everyone is leery about bringing 1,000 cadets into the New York metropolitan area for a ceremony,” she added. “It’s definitely a risk.” Mr. Trump, like some of his predecessors, has used the annual commencement addresses at the country’s military academies to promote his foreign policy successes and project strength, something he needs to do in the middle of a pandemic that has kept him in the White House in the middle of an election year. There will never be a better setting for the president to talk up the size and abilities of the United States military, and point to the uniformed ranks in front of him as examples of the patriotic Americans he has enlisted to fight the coronavirus and carry out his campaign promise from 2016 of winning “so much you’re going to get tired of winning.” Mr. Trump, who was so impressed by the Bastille Day parade he saw in Paris that he planned something similar in Washington until the Pentagon estimated its cost, basks in the glow of the spit-and-polish commencement ceremonies at the military academies. He spoke at Annapolis in 2018, and when he addressed the Air Force Academy graduation last year, the president stayed and shook hands with all 1,000 cadets. But it is West Point that holds special significance to Mr. Trump, aides said. A graduate of the New York Military Academy, he looks upon the West Point graduates serving in his administration with the same admiration he has for anyone with Ivy League credentials. It had been a longstanding plan that the president would deliver the commencement speech there in late May, White House officials said, adding that after the event was postponed, they were still in talks with the academy about finding a new date. White House officials said Mr. Trump left it up to the school to decide whether it was safe to hold a graduation ceremony in June, and pointed out that he could always reassess his decision closer to the date if the coronavirus crisis made it impossible for him to attend. But his appearance at West Point, while not in any way unusual or unexpected, had yet to be announced. Indeed, after all the West Point cadets were sent home for spring break in March, Lt. Gen. Darryl A. Williams, the West Point superintendent, ordered a working group there to draw up options — much like a battle campaign — for what to do about graduation, summer training and initiation day for incoming cadets. One option included a delayed presidential commencement speech in mid-June, but nothing had been decided, academy officials said. That is, nothing had been decided until last Friday, April 17, when, at a news conference, Mr. Trump was asked about Mr. Pence’s coming trip to the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. Mr. Trump told reporters that he would be speaking at the West Point graduation in the near future, noting that he did not like the look of a socially distanced graduation and that he hoped the “look” of the ceremony would be “nice and tight.” He did not announce a date for the event. West Point officials said this week that they were taken aback by the impromptu announcement. Of the many graduation options under review, Mr. Trump had pre-empted their planning. A White House official said that the administration had been in discussions with West Point about a new date for the graduation, and that the academy had offered June 13 as a possibility. On the morning of April 18, White House officials said, Mr. Trump had a discussion with the Defense Department, in which he confirmed that he would speak at West Point on June 13. At a news conference later that day, Mr. Trump publicly announced the date for the first time. “I’m going to West Point. I think they’re changing the date to June 13th because of what’s going on in New York,” he said. “They’re moving into June 13th. West Point.” In a statement, a White House official said that “the president had spoken with D.O.D. and his remarks on that Saturday were not a surprise to the academy.” By Wednesday, the academy had caught up to the president’s announcement. “We are honored to host the commander in chief as we celebrate the many accomplishments of our graduating class,” General Williams said in a statement. West Point officials say the size and scope of the ceremony will be determined “by safety considerations for cadets and the entire West Point community.” Academy officials say they have not yet decided whether parents or other visitors will be allowed to attend. General Williams said in a telephone interview that returning seniors would be tested off-campus for the coronavirus. Those who test negative will then be sent to the school, where they will be monitored for 14 days before graduation. While the campus has enough dormitory rooms for the 1,000 seniors, General Williams said that he was still deciding whether seniors would share bedrooms on their return. “All 1,000 of them will not intermix,” he said. “They’ll be in their rooms. They’ll have their masks on. Groups will be segregated in the mess hall when they eat.” Some faculty say this is not only inconvenient to cadets, but it is also a risk to their mental well-being. It has been an academic year marred by tragedy even before the outbreak. One cadet was killed and 21 others injured last June after a military vehicle overturned en route to a training exercise near the academy. In October, a cadet killed himself. General Williams, who managed the initial stages of the American military response to the Ebola pandemic in Liberia in 2014, said that he was drawing from his experiences during that outbreak. He spent three weeks in quarantine in Italy after returning from Liberia during Ebola, and said he planned to use some of what he had learned during his own isolation to help returning West Point seniors. “I’m not waiting for them to come back here to start worrying about their mental health,” he said.Since leaving campus in March, a handful of the academy’s 4,400 cadets have tested positive for the coronavirus, and about 30 staff and faculty members have tested positive, said Lt. Col. Christopher Ophardt, an academy spokesman. Graduating seniors, known as “firsties,” would have had to come back at some point to take final exams, pack up their belongings and out-process, some said. “If receiving their diploma and, most importantly, their commission with POTUS can top off that week, then my feeling is that all graduates would support it,” said Michael J. Meese, a retired one-star Army general who taught at West Point and served on Mr. Trump’s transition team, using the acronym for the president of the United States. West Point still has to clear a few more hurdles to realize Mr. Trump’s wish. The academy has asked Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper for waivers from a ban on travel for military personnel that runs through June 30, to allow cadets to return from all over the country. And no one knows what twist the coronavirus could take in New York by June 13. West Point officials say they will follow the guidance from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Army. “We’ll go by what they all say at that time,” said Colonel Ophardt, the academy spokesman.Helene Cooper, Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Thom Shanker contributed reporting."
A Few Thousand Protest Stay-at-Home Order at Wisconsin State Capitol,"WASHINGTON — A crowd of a few thousand gathered at Wisconsin’s State Capitol on Friday, the latest demonstration by conservative activists against statewide stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The protesters, bearing Trump campaign attire, Tea Party regalia and American flags, condemned Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, and his extension of “Safer at Home,” a declaration requiring Wisconsinites to practice social distancing and to close nonessential businesses through May 26. It was one of the nation’s largest gatherings to date to condemn stay-at-home orders enacted by state and local governments. And while Wisconsin’s elected Republicans and party officials encouraged people to attend, none spoke and only a few were spotted in the crowd. The Madison rally came as conservative groups have been encouraging resistance to stay-at-home orders across the country. It was promoted for days by Wisconsin’s conservative talk radio hosts and had thousands of R.S.V.P.s on a Facebook event page. How much public opinion in Wisconsin and elsewhere shifts toward reopening businesses, churches and schools most likely has far more to do with the rate of new coronavirus cases than it does frustration with the lockdowns. Wisconsin’s state health department announced 304 new positive tests on Friday, the most since the pandemic began. Those who protested on Friday said the broader set of facts mattered less than their personal experiences. “You’re being told to sit down and shut up because your opinion does not matter and you have to listen to professionals,” Madison Elmer, one of the event’s organizers, told the crowd at the beginning of the event. “You know what, you shouldn’t ever stop questioning the professionals.” The gathering revealed the lack of organization among the forces aligned against Wisconsin’s stay-at-home orders. Several speakers bemoaned the police for refusing to allow portable toilets to be set up on the Capitol grounds, a casualty of Governor Evers’s rejecting organizers’ application for a rally permit. Men in Hawaiian shirts toting guns walked through the crowd serving as ad hoc security. And there was little recognition that the number of coronavirus cases in the state is increasing by the day. Still, few in the crowd wore the protective face coverings public health officials have advised people to use outdoors during the coronavirus pandemic. People stood shoulder-to-shoulder on the grounds of the Capitol, with hundreds more circling downtown Madison streets in their cars. The police stayed at least six feet from protesters, but did not enforce social distancing rules. A parade of speakers lamented that local stores and restaurants were closed by the state’s order, but retailers like Walmart were considered essential and remain open. Both the audience and the speakers presented a cavalcade of grievances. One woman in the crowd shouted, “Open up the playgrounds, my kids want to play,” which brought cheers. “Staying indoors and worrying about the epidemic is more dangerous than going outside,” said Dr. Timothy W. Allen, a family physician from Cudahy, a Milwaukee suburb. “According to the evidence, you’re more likely to die by staying at home. You need to look at all lives, not just Covid lives.” Don Pridemore, a former state legislator who is running for a seat in the State Senate and attended the rally, circulated petitions Friday to begin a campaign to recall Mr. Evers, who was elected to a four-year term in 2018. Mr. Pridemore, 73, who lost a 2013 election to Mr. Evers to become the state’s superintendent of public instruction, said he did not feel it was necessary to wear a protective mask or gloves. “I was in Vietnam,” he said. “There were way more bugs there.”Earlier, at least 20 vehicles had gathered in the parking lot in Delafield, about an hour outside of Madison. Drivers mounted American flags, yellow “Don’t Tread on Me” Gadsden flags, which are a Tea Party emblem, and signs protesting the stay-at-home order. “We want Governor Evers to open up all businesses in the state immediately before everybody goes out of business,” said Bob Tarantino, a real estate agent who helped organize the caravan.  In Madison, demonstrators carried Trump campaign signs. Several displayed long guns — defying advice the treasurer of the Republican Party of Wisconsin gave to attendees earlier in the week. The protests came nearly three weeks after Wisconsin held the nation’s first in-person election as the country was wracked with the coronavirus. Since the April 7 contest, at least 19 people who voted in person or served as poll workers have tested positive for the virus. Wisconsin’s leading legislative Republicans, including Robin Vos, the Assembly speaker, have sued the governor to try to overturn the extension of the stay-at-home order. Mr. Vos encouraged people to gather in Madison on Friday but declined to say if he would attend or if he believed it was safe to do so. President Trump has encouraged uprisings against stay-at-home orders issued by Democratic governors in several states, though he has not spoken out against the Wisconsin order. Lawmakers were not permitted to speak at the rally, organizers said.“Trump, Robin Vos and Wisconsin Republicans bear personal responsibility for the protests taking place today and the infections that will spread because of them,” Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, said Friday. “They believe they can benefit politically,” he said, if they try to ignore “the dangerous science of coronavirus and its spread.”Reid J. Epstein reported from Washington and Kay Nolan from Madison and Delafield, Wis."
Biden Will Fund-Raise With D.N.C. and His Appointee Will Lead the Committee,"WASHINGTON — Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee have agreed to a joint fund-raising accord and installed the Biden campaign’s choice as the D.N.C.’s chief executive, the latest signs that the party’s presumptive presidential nominee has consolidated control over its broader functions. The new agreement, which party officials said would be made formal on Friday, will allow the former vice president to raise $360,600 from individual donors, with $5,600 going to the Biden campaign and the rest earmarked for the party committee. At the request of the Biden campaign, Mary Beth Cahill, a D.N.C. senior adviser who briefly served as its interim chief executive in 2018, will take over from Seema Nanda. Ms. Cahill, a longtime operative for the party, served as campaign manager for John Kerry’s 2004 presidential campaign. Mr. Kerry is a longtime friend of and 2020 campaign surrogate for Mr. Biden. Ms. Nanda will leave the D.N.C. The moves come as the Biden campaign exercises greater influence on the national committee, an effort that typically gets underway after a presidential nomination is assured. In the past, that has involved sending a team of aides to the party’s headquarters on South Capitol Street, but the coronavirus restrictions mean the Biden team will take over a party working from home. “Our goal is to ensure that we put Joe Biden in the best position possible to beat Donald Trump,” Ms. Cahill said. “This joint fund-raising agreement allows us to do just that.” Mr. Biden and the D.N.C. begin the general election period far behind President Trump and the Republican National Committee, which entered April with $244 million in the bank. Mr. Biden and the D.N.C. had a combined $57 million, after accounting for debts and the $18 million former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg transferred to the party following the failure of his $1 billion campaign. The agreement to raise funds together should help Mr. Biden accelerate his efforts to close that substantial gap. Until this week, he had been legally limited to soliciting checks for only $5,600. Now he can directly ask for more than 60 times that amount with almost all of it going to the party committee. Some donors had been confused in recent weeks at the delay for setting up such an accord. Ultimately, the initial agreement is exclusively between the D.N.C. and the Biden campaign; the maximum contribution is likely to increase in the future as Democratic state parties are included. In 2016, an early joint agreement between Hillary Clinton and the D.N.C. was the subject of controversy as supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont complained that Mrs. Clinton was influencing the party through her financial support. Those residual feelings were one reason the D.N.C. and Mr. Biden avoided establishing such a pact until after Mr. Sanders had formally exited the race. Ms. Cahill, an ally of the D.N.C. chairman, Tom Perez, since he worked with her in the office of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, ran the last Democratic presidential campaign against a Republican incumbent in the White House, when Mr. Kerry challenged President George W. Bush. Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, praised Ms. Cahill’s appointment to lead the party. “Mary Beth’s experience running presidential campaigns and managing the kind of complex operation it takes to win a general election will be invaluable, and I am thrilled to have her as a partner in this fight,” Ms. O’Malley Dillon said. In addition, Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden’s former campaign manager, has been dispatched as a liaison between the campaign and the D.N.C. for the general election. He was replaced by Ms. O’Malley Dillon in March. Another looming organizational choice for the Biden campaign is whether to contract with a digital services firm called Hawkfish that was created by Mr. Bloomberg ahead of his presidential run. The firm has pitched itself to run much of the Biden campaign’s digital operations, rather than the campaign building out its own internal operation, according to people familiar with the matter. Hawkfish has quickly become a flash point in the party. Several Democratic digital operatives have warned the Biden campaign publicly and privately against contracting with Hawkfish, arguing that the firm has limited political experience and that its lone big race — for Mr. Bloomberg — did not include any fund-raising or efforts to spend money efficiently. Both are major imperatives for the Biden campaign. On the other side, the firm is promising access to large amounts of data it has collected and fresh know-how from a Silicon Valley team imported from outside the usual circle of politics. Whether or not to use Hawkfish is a hot-button decision thrust onto the desk of Ms. O’Malley Dillon, though conversations with the firm predate her taking over the campaign."
"Opposed to Bailouts, but in This Case Willing to Take One","WASHINGTON — Among the applicants for loans from the Small Business Administration’s stimulus package is the foundation arm of FreedomWorks, a conservative operation that advocates small government and made its name opposing bailouts. “I would love someone to give us free cash,” said Adam Brandon, the president of FreedomWorks, expressing frustration over the effects of the crisis on his group, which is working to build support for President Trump’s effort to reopen the economy. At the other end of the ideological spectrum, liberal groups like the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center and Media Matters for America have also applied for some of the small-business loans, which can be fully forgiven if the recipients use them to keep workers on their payrolls. The groups on the left may be more comfortable than those on the right with the idea of federal government assistance, but accepting help from an administration they regularly criticize has left them debating how to balance their independence with their ability to keep functioning during an economic crisis. “It’s hard for me to imagine that any of these liberal groups are going to pull their punches on criticizing government because they got a loan,” said Gara LaMarche, the president of Democracy Alliance, a club of major liberal donors who support some of the top groups on the left, including Media Matters. He said his staff was consulting with some of the groups to which the Democracy Alliance steered funds, and expected many would apply for S.B.A. loans “as a matter of sound management and stewardship.” But Mr. LaMarche added, “It’s not hard to imagine Trump keeping track, and then not forgiving the loans of groups he deems critical!” Many struggling mom-and-pop business have been unable to obtain S.B.A. loans from a program established as part of the $2.2 trillion bailout plan passed by Congress and signed into law by Mr. Trump, even as larger publicly traded businesses have obtained loans from the program. A provision in the legislation, which socially conservative organizations recommended to Republican lawmakers, made clear that certain nonprofit groups could apply as well. The provision opened the door for taxpayer funding to subsidize well-connected organizations that are part of the political fray in an election year. And at least a few groups — on both sides of the political spectrum — decided to apply, so far with mixed results. The Congressional Progressive Caucus Center’s application for a $160,000 loan is awaiting resolution, as is FreedomWorks Foundation’s request for $300,000, according to officials at the groups. The American Civil Liberties Union’s national office has not applied but 14 of its state affiliates have, and at least one received a loan — of $154,000 — so far, said Anthony D. Romero, the executive director of the A.C.L.U. A “small” loan request by Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal group supporting Mr. Trump’s plan to reopen the country, is still pending, said the organization’s chairman. An application from Media Matters has been hampered by a technical problem, said a person familiar with the process, who was not aware if the group had reapplied. The Small Business Administration has already spent the initial $349 billion allocated in the bailout bill for the loan program, known as the Paycheck Protection Program. But the program is set to get a $320 billion infusion from another bill that won final congressional approval on Thursday. Various types of institutions and industries, including universities and news organizations, have been caught up in the debate over who should benefit from the $2.2 trillion bailout bill. In the case of nonprofits, critics argue it is not a good use of government money to prop up groups trying to influence the political debate in the middle of a presidential campaign. They point out that such groups do not pay taxes, and as such already receive a form of subsidy from the government. And they note that some taxpaying for-profit businesses that focus on politics are unable to avail themselves of the funding because Small Business Administration regulations prohibit loans to businesses that get more than half their revenue from political or lobbying work. “There is a complete double standard,” said Eli B. Karabell, a political consultant in St. Louis who sought to apply for an $87,000 S.B.A. loan for his business, but was informed by his bank he was ineligible. Mr. Karabell had to lay off three employees, according to a lawsuit the American Association of Political Consultants filed against the S.B.A. seeking to overturn the ban on loans to political businesses as an infringement on free speech. “It is completely wrong and completely reprehensible for the government to be subsidizing these nonprofits, but our real Main Street, small-town businesses are not getting this money,” Mr. Karabell said. Defenders note that the provision in the stimulus bill paving the way for S.B.A. loans to nonprofits applies to all groups registered under a section of the tax code — 501(c)(3) — that covers churches and other religious institutions, as well as charities and educational entities, most of which rely largely on donations. Some of those entities play important roles in communities across the country and employ significant numbers of people, some of whom might be out of a job if fund-raising declines as donors feel the pinch of the economic collapse. While the tax code bans those groups from endorsing candidates or engaging in other partisan political activity, they are allowed to spend money advocating policy positions at the heart of political fights. And many of the most active political organizations maintain 501(c)(3) foundation arms, including FreedomWorks, which plans to use its FreedomWorks Foundation to publicize ideas on how to restart the economy. Its larger political arm is helping organize protests of state and local restrictions on business and travel intended to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. The restrictions forced the cancellation of FreedomWorks’ annual fund-raiser and led to a dip in donations. The group applied for the S.B.A. loan as one potential option to avoid cuts, Mr. Brandon said. Liberty Counsel, which is leading a campaign to reopen churches next week, worked with allies on Capitol Hill to push for the inclusion of nonprofit groups in the S.B.A. section of the stimulus bill, according to Mat Staver, the group’s chairman. “Obviously, with the stock market, people out of jobs, so many people unemployed, they’re not donating,” he said. “It still impacts any nonprofits whether you’re essential or not.” The group submitted an application the morning the small-business process opened, but it has yet to receive a loan, which Mr. Staver attributed to larger corporations flooding the program. Some conservative lawyers who represent such groups have encouraged them to apply partly as a matter of principle. “Their financial situation is precarious, or will be, not because of anything they did or did not do — but because the governments at every level closed down the economy and cost them their donors’ ability to fund their programs,” said Cleta Mitchell, a conservative Washington lawyer who represents many nonprofit groups. Not all conservative groups agree.The Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, decided not to apply for a loan, arguing in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal that accepting the funds would be anathema to the group’s mission of promoting limited government. In an interview, Cato’s president, Peter Goettler, called it “a moral issue of the state taking money from one group and giving it to another.” For liberal groups like the A.C.L.U.’s national office, the calculus is different but still complicated. “The perception of independence is really important for an organization like ours that holds government’s feet to the fire,” Mr. Romero said. Nonetheless, he said the organization did not prohibit its state affiliates from applying on their own, partly because they primarily serve as watchdogs against local and state governments. Likewise, the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center, a nonprofit funded largely by donations from liberal foundations, said taking the assistance would not affect its work, which includes pushing for more assistance for workers in coronavirus relief legislation. “We have not laid anyone off yet, and we’re hoping not to, but we’re facing significant financial uncertainty right now, as are a lot of other nonprofits,” said Liz Watson, the center’s executive director. “If we do get a loan, this will help us keep people in their jobs.”"
Trump’s Suggestion That Disinfectants Could Be Used to Treat Coronavirus Prompts Aggressive Pushback,"WASHINGTON — In Maryland, so many callers flooded a health hotline with questions that the state’s Emergency Management Agency had to issue a warning that “under no circumstances” should any disinfectant be taken to treat the coronavirus. In Washington State, officials urged people not to consume laundry detergent capsules. Across the country on Friday, health professionals sounded the alarm. Injecting bleach or highly concentrated rubbing alcohol “causes massive organ damage and the blood cells in the body to basically burst,” Dr. Diane P. Calello, the medical director of the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System, said in an interview. “It can definitely be a fatal event.” Even the makers of Clorox and Lysol pleaded with Americans not to inject or ingest their products.The frantic reaction was prompted by President Trump’s suggestion on Thursday at a White House briefing that an “injection inside” the human body with a disinfectant like bleach or isopropyl alcohol could help combat the virus. “And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute,” Mr. Trump said after a presentation from William N. Bryan, an acting under secretary for science at the Department of Homeland Security, detailed the virus’s possible susceptibility to bleach and alcohol. “One minute,” the president said. “And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that.” Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, was sitting to the side in the White House briefing room, blinking hard and looking at the floor as he spoke. Later, Mr. Trump asked her if she knew about “the heat and the light” as a potential cure. “Not as a treatment,” Dr. Birx said, adding, “I haven’t seen heat or light —” before the president cut her off. Mr. Trump’s remarks caused an immediate uproar, and the White House spent much of Friday trying to walk them back. Also Friday, the Food and Drug Administration warned that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, two drugs that the president has repeatedly recommended in treating the coronavirus, can cause dangerous abnormalities in heart rhythm in coronavirus patients and has resulted in some deaths. The F.D.A. said the drugs should be used only in clinical trials or hospitals where patients can be closely monitored for heart problems. “Leave it to the media to irresponsibly take President Trump out of context and run with negative headlines,” Kayleigh McEnany, the new White House press secretary, said in a statement criticizing the coverage of Thursday night’s briefing. But the president later undermined her argument by insisting that his question to Mr. Bryan in fact had been an elaborate prank that he had engineered to trick reporters. “I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,” Mr. Trump said on Friday to journalists gathered in the Oval Office. The president said he had posed his theory on cleaning the body with disinfectant “in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter,” which also was not true — he had said it unprompted to Mr. Bryan. With more questions likely at the Friday briefing, Vice President Mike Pence, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, abruptly ended it shortly after it began. Several White House officials said they shared the view that Mr. Trump had been taken out of context, even as they acknowledged that his comments were problematic. They noted that the president had later directed the same comments to Dr. Birx, and suggested them as a course of study, as opposed to a recommendation of a course of action for the American public. But they acknowledged that Mr. Trump’s delivery was too sloppy for a president in the middle of managing the response to a pandemic that has killed over 45,000 Americans. Some said it was one of the worst days in one of the worst weeks of his presidency. Others inside the administration raised questions about why Mr. Bryan, whose background is not in health or science, had been invited to deliver a presentation. Mr. Bryan, whose expertise is in energy infrastructure and security, is serving in an acting capacity as the head of the department’s science and technology directorate. Mr. Bryan served 17 years in the Army, followed by yearslong stints as a civil servant at the Defense and Energy Departments. The latter role led to a whistle-blower complaint accusing him, in part, of manipulating government policy to further his personal financial interests, and then lying to Congress about those interests. The United States Office of Special Counsel, a federal agency that investigates whistle-blower complaints, asked the Energy Department last year to investigate the accusations against Mr. Bryan. In January, the Senate returned his nomination to the White House. Mr. Bryan was invited by the vice president’s office to coronavirus task force meetings on Wednesday and Thursday to talk about a study that his department had done relating to heat and the conditions in which the coronavirus can thrive or be dampened. On Thursday, Mr. Bryan presented a graphic to the room, according to four people briefed on the events. Mr. Pence’s advisers wanted Mr. Bryan to brief the news media on his findings, but several West Wing staff members objected, partly because they were concerned the information had not been verified. Before Mr. Bryan took the lectern in the White House Briefing Room, Dr. Birx and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a member of the coronavirus task force, made a few revisions to his presentation, officials said. As he listened to Mr. Bryan, the president became increasingly excited, and also felt the need to demonstrate his own understanding of science, according to three of the advisers. So Mr. Trump went ahead with his theories about the chemicals. Later in the briefing, Phil Rucker, a reporter for The Washington Post, asked the president why he had had that discussion because “people tuning into these briefings, they want to get information and guidance and want to know what to do — they’re not looking for a rumor.” “Hey, Phil,” he responded. “I’m the president, and you’re fake news.”The backlash was swift. A host of corporations, doctors and government officials quickly stepped forward to issue an identical warning: Cleaning products are extremely dangerous to ingest — potentially deadly — and no one should do so. Speaker Nancy Pelosi ridiculed Mr. Trump’s comments as she criticized his priorities for coronavirus relief. “The president is asking people to inject Lysol into their lungs,” she said, calling it an indication that “Republicans reject science.” And Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, added his own criticism.“I can’t believe I have to say this,” Mr. Biden posted on Twitter on Friday afternoon, “but please don’t drink bleach.” Dr. Jerome M. Adams, the surgeon general, also issued a warning through his Twitter feed — the closest he has come so far to walking back the president’s words. “A reminder to all Americans- PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/ medication to yourself or a loved one,” Dr. Adams said. “Your safety is paramount, and doctors and nurses are have years of training to recommend what’s safe and effective.” Mr. Trump’s hopeful comments about disinfectant use coincided with an alarming rise in accidents with household cleaning products in recent weeks, according to doctors who monitor activity at poison call centers. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a growing number of calls to poison control centers and a significant increase in accidental exposures to household cleaners and disinfectants. The F.D.A. has moved to tamp down on merchants online that have encouraged the ingestion of products made with disinfectants and cleaning agents, including chlorine dioxide, a compound commonly used as a bleach. The products have found favor with conspiracy theorists and fringe activists online who peddle chlorine dioxide as “Magical Mineral Solution,” or M.M.S. One such activist, Mark Grenon, claimed after the president’s briefing that “Trump has got the M.M.S. and all the info,” according to The Guardian. Mr. Grenon did not reply to an email seeking comment, nor did the White House. On Friday, a person familiar with the situation said senior administration officials were not familiar with Mr. Grenon or his letter. Social media platforms have also moved to filter out the circulation of junk science and bad information online, using disinfectants as a prime example. Last month, Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, specifically mentioned a bleach “cure” as an example of “misinformation that has imminent risk of danger.” “Things like, ‘You can cure this by drinking bleach,’” he said. “I mean, that’s just in a different class.” A spokesman for Twitter said on Friday that the president’s statements did “not violate our Covid-19 misinformation policy.”Katie Rogers reported from Washington, and Christine Hauser, Alan Yuhas and Maggie Haberman from New York.

Biden Leads Trump in Key States. But Hillary Clinton Led by More.,"Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election.If the presidential election were held today, polls in crucial swing states like Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania suggest that Joseph R. Biden Jr. would be in position for a narrow victory. The disquieting news for Democrats is that at the same point in 2016, Hillary Clinton was in a better position. Some Americans have lost faith in President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, but the country’s deeply entrenched partisan divide has prevented the president from losing more than a few percentage points on his overall approval rating. Besides, the Electoral College has a meaningful Republican tilt, and those who turn out to vote tend to be slightly more conservative than the general population. Add to that Republicans’ efforts to limit access to voting among predominantly Democratic populations, and Mr. Trump might well become the first president in history to win two full terms without once winning a plurality of the popular vote. State polls proved problematic during the 2016 presidential race — that much is well known. But with no guarantee that a repeat won’t occur this year, it bears noting that Mrs. Clinton was considerably further ahead of Mr. Trump in many swing state polls in spring 2016 than Mr. Biden is now. Real Clear Politics polling averages show Mr. Biden leading Mr. Trump in most polls of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. But on average, the former vice president’s lead in each of those states’ aggregates is only about half what Mrs. Clinton’s was at this point in 2016, six months before she was defeated. Trump’s ‘golden rule’ applies during the crisis.So far the golden rule of Mr. Trump’s presidency — that his approval ratings shall not budge more than a few percentage points — has held true throughout the coronavirus pandemic. Since the start of this year, his ratings have wavered but never left the mid- to high 40s. That carries over into perceptions of how Mr. Trump has dealt with the coronavirus specifically. And, importantly, it holds true in swing states. A University of New Hampshire poll released this week had encouraging news for Mr. Trump. While his overall virus approval rating in that state remained underwater, independents’ approval jumped in the past month by 21 percentage points, showing that his message — inconsistent though it may be — is still persuasive for some key voters. Surveys released this week of Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania found approval of his handling of the pandemic varying from 44 percent to 46 percent of registered voters in those states, reflective of the national average. In Michigan and Pennsylvania, Biden doesn’t necessarily benefit from people’s support of Democratic governors.These new state polls show that even in places where Mr. Trump has clashed with popular Democratic governors, Mr. Biden will not be able to lean on support for state-level Democrats in his fight against the president. In Fox News polls of Michigan and Pennsylvania, well over three in five voters approved of their Democratic governor’s job performance, including large majorities of independents and moderates. But in each case, that was far more than those who said they would vote for Mr. Biden in November. And voters appear to see their governor as separate from their vote in the presidential election. In a hypothetical matchup against Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden didn’t do markedly better when Michigan voters were asked about a hypothetical ticket that included their governor, Gretchen Whitmer, as his running mate. In each case, 49 percent said they would vote for Mr. Biden over Mr. Trump. In Florida, Biden emerges from the primary race looking weakened — but with room to grow.A Quinnipiac University poll of Florida released on Wednesday showed Mr. Biden with a slight edge among registered voters, but that spread of four percentage points was within the margin of error. Mr. Biden has fallen since June, when he led Mr. Trump, 50 percent to 41 percent. Biden’s victorious campaign for the Democratic nomination has done little to put wind in the former vice president’s sails, but rather has left him in a slightly worse position in a matchup against Mr. Trump than when he began. And with the pandemic keeping Mr. Biden holed up in Delaware, he has struggled to command a bully pulpit since becoming the Democrats’ presumptive nominee. Mr. Biden’s favorability rating is now just 43 percent among registered voters in Florida, down from 49 percent in a Quinnipiac poll of the state a year ago. His plus-3 net favorability rating there is now within the margin of error. Still, 14 percent of Floridians haven’t made up their mind about him, meaning he has far more room to grow than does Mr. Trump, whose net rating is minus-7. Hispanic voters play an important role in Florida, and in this demographic Mr. Biden looks anemic. He lost the Hispanic vote to Senator Bernie Sanders in many primaries and caucuses this year, and the new Quinnipiac poll of Florida shows him leading Mr. Trump by just eight percentage points among Hispanic voters, 46 percent to 38 percent. In 2016, both pre-election surveys and exit polls showed Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Trump by three times as many percentage points among Hispanic voters in Florida. Among black voters there, too, Mr. Biden shows signs of surprising weakness. Twelve percent said they did not yet know whom they would support, a higher rate of uncertainty than in other demographics. Young voters remain lukewarm on Biden.Young people are a demographic in which Mr. Biden badly underperforms compared with most recent Democratic presidential nominees. In Florida, voters under 35 are actually more likely to see Mr. Biden unfavorably than to hold a positive view of him. But 27 percent say they don’t know enough to feel one way or the other, so he has room to improve. He leads Mr. Trump by just nine percentage points among Florida voters under 35, a relatively weak edge compared with Mrs. Clinton’s lead of 22 percentage points among this group in a Quinnipiac poll at this point in 2016. Among millennials in Michigan, Mr. Biden squeaks by with just a 50 percent to 45 percent favorability rating, according to the Fox News poll. He leads Mr. Trump by just eight percentage points among millennials in a head-to-head matchup. Older voters like Biden, and don’t like Trump’s virus response.Mr. Biden tends to make up for his relatively weak leads among millennials and Hispanic voters with his strength among those 65 and older. Compared with Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 totals, polls suggest Mr. Biden has made the most gains among the oldest voters. These voters have largely been unimpressed with Mr. Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, and they will be particularly crucial if Mr. Biden expects to win Florida, which has trended Republican over the past 10 years. Those 65 and over broke for Mr. Trump by 17 percentage points in 2016. In the Fox polls of Michigan and Pennsylvania, and the Quinnipiac poll of Florida, the oldest voters were consistently the most likely to say that their states should err on the side of keeping their economies closed out of a concern for safety — a stance that Mr. Trump has been reluctant to embrace. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, resisted calls for weeks to put in place a statewide stay-at-home order, and his handling of the crisis has drawn some of the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the country."
Did America Learn Anything From the Last Economic Crisis?,"Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Even when that history is only a decade old, evidently. The global financial crisis, the deep recession it caused, and the weak recovery that followed have produced plenty of lessons about helping the economy escape from a period of trauma. The United States seems to be ignoring some of them in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. Several prominent Republicans in recent days have raised alarm bells about rising public debt. They’ve also indicated their opposition to further financial help for state and local governments. Leaders of both parties in Congress have structured business bailouts as loans from the Federal Reserve rather than as direct assistance to struggling companies. And signs of bailout fatigue are already starting to appear, particularly among Republicans — raising the risk that government help for the economy will dry up before a potential coronavirus depression is contained — which was a key reason the last economic recovery was so slow for so long. “The pandemic response got off to a really promising start, with everyone coming together with a whatever-it-takes attitude,” said Jason Furman, who shaped economic policy in response to the global financial crisis as a staffer in the Obama White House. “But we’re slipping back into the types of gridlock, over-optimism about the economy and over-pessimism on the deficit that followed the financial crisis and unnecessarily prolonged the economic pain.” Consider a few of the experiences from that earlier episode that might inform the pandemic response. In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, there were heated bipartisan warnings about excessive public debt — warnings that the United States risked hitting a tipping point of spiking interest rates and fiscal crisis if it did not curtail borrowing. A high-profile bipartisan commission was formed to plan ways to reduce the trajectory of deficits. The Obama White House and congressional Republicans in 2011 embarked on lengthy negotiations over a “grand bargain” to reduce future entitlement spending. Those efforts came to naught. But not only did no debt crisis occur — the opposite happened. Interest rates and inflation have stayed persistently low for the last decade, and demand for Treasury bonds has remained very high. With the economy now in free fall, even many fiscal hawks are embracing large-scale deficit spending to help the economy emerge from the pandemic in better shape. Interest rates have fallen to record lows — 10-year Treasury bonds yielded only 0.6 percent Thursday — indicating investors are willing to lend to the U.S. government on generous terms. Economists see the last crisis as a reminder that deficit spending during a recession is desirable if it can prevent long-term economic damage. “A key lesson from the 2008 period is that crises can have long shadows if there is damage to the economic structure,” said Karen Dynan, a Harvard economist and a former Treasury Department official. “The economic scarring if lots of businesses go bankrupt and households are wiped out financially in this episode would be a failure of policy. Based on the 2008 experience, a real concern is that we will tire of fiscal stimulus before the need for that money runs out.” Already, there is uncertainty about the federal government’s willingness to support states financially — which has a particular parallel with the not-too-distant past. In early 2010, the private sector in the United States turned a corner and began consistently creating jobs. But around the same time, state and local governments were facing the delayed effects of plunging tax revenue. Unlike the federal government, states generally must balance their budgets, and do not have a central bank to ensure their access to funds. As a result, their only option was to enact huge spending cuts just as the rest of the economy was starting to turn around. State and local governments shed 570,000 jobs from 2010 to 2012, contributing to a perennially weak economic recovery. If an extra 570,000 people had been working at the end of 2012, the jobless rate would have been 7.5 percent instead of 7.9 percent. Some funds had been allocated to states in the 2009 fiscal stimulus bill, but Congress was unwilling to seriously consider the possibility of allocating more. Republicans were dead set against the idea of bailing out states’ finances, and even many Democrats in Congress were wary, disinclined to help political rivals in state houses and governors’ mansions. Now, states face plummeting tax revenue and new costs tied to treatment of the virus. Republicans blocked Democratic requests to add more money for states in the latest rescue legislation, and the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said on Wednesday that “there’s not going to be any desire on the Republican side to bail out state pensions by borrowing money from future generations” and that states should consider filing for bankruptcy if necessary. The ground may also be shifting on programs to encourage businesses to keep making payroll.Controversies that have emerged around programs to support small businesses suggest that the politics of industry bailouts are becoming more toxic. Outcry over some midsize companies that obtained forgivable loans through the Paycheck Protection Program suggests that public stigma and political blowback could be attached to taking advantage of the federal rescue — which could undermine the ability of the program to fulfill its goal of preventing layoffs even as Congress scales up its size. “Identifying individual companies and trying to paint a picture of a program that’s not doing well does suggest that the kind of bailout fatigue that existed 12 years ago is lurking very close to the surface and may even be popping up above the surface,” said Michael Strain, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Finally, Congress has repeated another behavior from the global financial crisis: relying to an extraordinary degree on the Federal Reserve to carry out steps aimed at fixing the economy, rather than taking direct action itself. In 2008, that meant the Bush administration relied on the Fed to rescue Bear Stearns and AIG; in 2009, it meant the Obama administration used a Fed program to support lending as a key part of its crisis response. For years thereafter, as Congress refrained from new fiscal action, the Fed enacted quantitative easing to try to keep the economy on track. The Fed has a lot of strengths. It is run by capable technocrats, can act quickly, and has the unique capacity to create dollars out of thin air. But it also has limitations. Its tools generally work through financial markets, which means it is better at improving financial conditions generally than at helping individual industries that are experiencing problems. And though it has wide authority to lend money to solvent borrowers, it is not legally allowed to spend money — for example, to directly pay businesses to keep their payrolls high, or to send money to individuals. Now, the core of the Trump administration’s strategy — with bipartisan support in Congress — has been to authorize Treasury funds to be used by the Fed for new programs to lend to businesses. “The Fed is great at stabilizing the financial system, but it’s not well designed to target specific segments of the economy,” said David Beckworth, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. “Giving grants is a much more effective and efficient manner of helping businesses out than the Fed giving loans.” In that sense, Congress’s desire to avoid the sticker shock of spending huge sums directly could make its rescue efforts less effective than they otherwise might have been. In all these areas, the great test for the government is whether it can engineer a response enabling the economy to come out of the pandemic without being much smaller — without the years of inadequate growth that followed the 2008 crisis, which kept millions of people from fulfilling their productive potential for years. If the recent trends hold up, the post-pandemic years could be another way in which history repeats itself."
Black Leaders Want a Black Woman as Biden’s Running Mate. But Who?,"Four years ago, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey made his vice-presidential pitch to Hillary Clinton at her Washington home, months before she faced Donald J. Trump in the November election. Mr. Booker, the only African-American to make Mrs. Clinton’s shortlist, argued that the presence of a black running mate would motivate black voters, helping Mrs. Clinton recreate the coalition that backed former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. But Mrs. Clinton had won the Democratic nomination with substantial black support, and some of her advisers argued that many black voters would already be energized by Mr. Trump’s divisive candidacy and appeals to white conservatives, according to several people involved in the selection. After weighing the strengths and weaknesses of Mr. Booker, among others, she chose Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a white moderate widely seen as a safe, traditional pick. “Kaine brought good and solid credentials,” said Minyon Moore, a key adviser to Mrs. Clinton who participated in the selection process. “But the difference between a Cory and Tim Kaine could’ve closed the enthusiasm gap. Looking back on it, it’s fair for people to ask if we should’ve factored enthusiasm more into it.” No two presidential cycles are completely analogous, but as former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. begins his search for a running mate, Mrs. Clinton’s loss and the weaker-than-expected black turnout in 2016 are on the minds of top Democrats. Mr. Biden has already committed to selecting a woman, and he and his allies have repeatedly mentioned two black women as possibilities — Senator Kamala Harris of California and Stacey Abrams, the party’s 2018 nominee for governor of Georgia — as well as several white women, particularly Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. Pressure has been growing on Mr. Biden to choose a black woman to inspire black turnout this fall and not take it for granted. The Rev. Al Sharpton, for instance, who speaks to Mr. Biden regularly, is to announce his support for Ms. Abrams as vice president as soon as next week, according to those familiar with his plans. Yet Mr. Biden is facing other factors and pressures as well. He has said he wants someone who is prepared to step into the vice presidency immediately, a nod to the value he puts on government and leadership experience. He would be the oldest president ever, 78 on Inauguration Day, and is looking for a partner and, possibly, a potential successor. With the country deep into the coronavirus pandemic, voters will also assess whether his running mate appears capable of handling the worst national crisis since World War II. Ms. Harris, who has statewide and national experience, is seen in the Biden camp as a more likely pick than Ms. Abrams, who was a state legislative leader for a decade before losing her bid for governor. Still, some Democrats believe that choosing a hands-on governor or veteran senator is a better fit for the crisis than Ms. Harris, who was attorney general of California and has been in the Senate for three years. Mr. Biden’s selection has also become a vehicle for a broader debate among Democrats about the best strategy to win back the White House. While candidates like Ms. Harris or Ms. Abrams could energize core Democratic constituencies such as black voters or younger voters, as well as women, Ms. Whitmer and Ms. Klobuchar could be a geographic plus, considering they hail from the Upper Midwest region important to the Electoral College. Among some black leaders and activists close to Mr. Biden, including Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and former Democratic Party chair Donna Brazile, a commitment to selecting a woman is not enough. They have publicly and privately pushed Mr. Biden to select a black woman, arguing black voter enthusiasm may hinge on it.  “I’m rooting for everybody black,” said Leah Daughtry, the former chief executive of the Democratic National Convention, quoting the actress Issa Rae who used the phrase at the 2017 Emmys. Mr. Sharpton, the civil rights activist and talk show host, said Mr. Biden “will get the overwhelming majority of the black vote, the question is turnout.” “Now I’ve told him my preference is for a black woman, but you’ve got to also choose the right black woman,” Mr. Sharpton said in an interview. “In the middle of this pandemic, you have to choose someone that people, and particularly black people, believe can govern from day one.” Ms. Abrams herself has been outspoken on the issue, taking the unusual route of publicly making the case for why Mr. Biden should choose her. She also said, during an interview this week on ABC’s “The View,” that she would have “concerns” if Mr. Biden didn’t choose a woman of color as his running mate. “Women of color, particularly black women are the strongest part of the Democratic Party, the most loyal,” she said. “We need a ticket that reflects the diversity of America.” There is no precedent for the selection of a black running mate. There is also little evidence that vice-presidential selections sway general elections in any meaningful way, including Mrs. Clinton’s selection of Mr. Kaine in 2016. Still, citing the dip in black turnout four years ago, and the importance of black urban centers such as Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Detroit, and Cleveland in the Electoral College, proponents like Mr. Sharpton argue that a black woman could help Mr. Biden. In 2016, the black voter turnout rate in a presidential election declined for the first time in 20 years, it was seven percentage points lower than the record highs of Mr. Obama’s 2012 re-election. The black share of the electorate also slipped from 13 percent in 2012 to 12 percent in 2016, a difference of 1.5 million black voters, according to Ted Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies how race affects voting behavior. Aimee Allison, the founder of She The People, a political group aiming to increase participation from all women of color by three to five percentage points in the general election, said a survey of her organization’s members preferred Ms. Abrams, with Ms. Harris coming in second. “Among black women primary voters, we saw Joe Biden was head and shoulders the pick,” Ms. Allison said. “But what we need to do now is expand across demographics to places where someone like Sanders showed strength — among Latinas in Texas and Nevada, and with Asian-Americans.”  But a preference for Ms. Abrams — or Ms. Harris — is far from a consensus opinion, with the jockeying wrapped up in part in personal histories and Washington power plays. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has encouraged allies to float names of House members like Representatives Val Demings of Florida and Marcia Fudge of Ohio, according to people familiar with those conversations, in part to reward members of her caucus with a higher profile. Several leaders in the Congressional Black Caucus, an organization steeped in tradition, have preferred Ms. Harris, who is a member. Georgia politicians like Atlanta’s former mayor Kasim Reed and its current mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, who endorsed Mr. Biden early and is a top surrogate, are former political rivals of Ms. Abrams. A recent comment from Mr. Clyburn publicly undercut Ms. Abrams in favor of Ms. Bottoms. Mr. Clyburn, who declined an interview request for this article, said Ms. Abrams lacked sufficient experience. “There is a young lady right there in Georgia who I think would make a tremendous V.P. candidate, and that’s the mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms,” he said in March. Mr. Biden has been cautious about saying too much about his preferences. He said this week he expected to form a selection panel for his running mate by May 1 and has repeatedly said his top priority is a governing partner he can trust, someone with whom he is “simpatico.” During an interview with local television in Pittsburgh this week, Mr. Biden said he would choose Michelle Obama as his running mate “in a heartbeat,” but thought she did not want to return to the White House. He largely pivoted away from a question about a black woman serving as his running mate, noting that he had already committed to nominating a black woman for the Supreme Court. “I’ll commit to that be a woman because it is very important that my administration look like the public, look like the nation,” Mr. Biden said. “There will be a woman of color on the Supreme Court. That doesn’t mean there won’t be a vice president, as well.” Recent state polls, including in Florida and Michigan, indicate that Mr. Biden begins the general election in a position of relative strength, with stronger support among older voters than Mrs. Clinton had in 2016 exit polls.  Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for Mrs. Clinton’s 2016 campaign, said that Mr. Biden should make decisions that keep intact his winning primary campaign coalition: ideological moderates, black voters and older voters, among others. “He had a huge win on Super Tuesday, so what does that tell you about his support and what it’s about?” Ms. Palmieri said. “I would, like, not want to mess with that magic. That’s going to be your ticket into November,” she added, as opposed to “walking away from that and thinking, ‘OK, now we need some other kind of coalition.’” Some black Democrats said that choosing Ms. Klobuchar or Ms. Whitmer could make political sense. Ms. Moore from the Clinton campaign said Mr. Biden deserved full deference in making his selection, even if she prefers a black woman as his choice. Others cited political liabilities for Ms. Abrams or Ms. Harris, considering Ms. Abrams is untested nationally and Ms. Harris struggled to excite black voters during her 2020 presidential run. In a national poll of black voters from The Washington Post and Ipsos earlier this year, just over a quarter said that in the event a white candidate won the nomination, it would be important for them to see a black person chosen as the running mate. Seventy-four percent of black Democratic voters said this would not be very important to them. But Ms. Brazile, who is close to Mr. Biden, offered a warning. Given that several black women are qualified for the role, she said, Mr. Biden risks striking an unintended and problematic note about their fitness to serve if he goes in a different direction.  “Biden has street cred, but at the same time, it’s important to send a message — to send a signal and to brand the Democratic Party as a party of diversity,” she said. “And I think any other message will be read as rejection.” Ms. Brazile considered her words.“I know that sounds awful, but it’s true,” she said. “It will be seen as a rejection of viable black women.”Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting."
Trump Is Harsh on Immigration. That Doesn’t Mean Biden Has the Latino Vote.,"LOS ANGELES — There’s talk of protecting the country from the “Invisible Enemy” by temporarily blocking people from receiving green cards. New footage of the construction of the southern border wall is available to stream online from a government website. If there was any doubt, this week made it clear: President Trump is making his anti-immigration message a cornerstone of his re-election campaign. And yet Latino voters are not, so far, indicating they will turn out in decisive numbers for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is counting on their support to win key swing states including Arizona, Florida and Pennsylvania. New polling indicates that 45 percent of Latinos approve of the president’s handling of the coronavirus. While Mr. Biden remains the choice of the majority of registered Hispanic voters, at 59 percent, Mr. Trump is the choice of 22 percent, according to a poll released Friday by Latino Decisions, a Los Angeles-based Democratic polling firm. Though the polling was conducted before his most recent statements and actions on immigration and the coronavirus, it is the latest evidence that Mr. Trump maintains steady support from a significant slice of Latino voters. Several polls of Latinos in battleground states have consistently shown Mr. Trump receiving slightly more than 20 percent of the votes. The poll also shows that enthusiasm for Mr. Biden seems to be slipping — he was favored by 67 percent of registered Latino voters in February. “Even as Trump is continuing this immigrant bashing, these voters are not blaming him for what is going on in the country right now — they are giving him the benefit of the doubt,” said Matt Barreto, who runs the polling firm. “There is an enthusiasm deficit — people are losing their jobs, losing their health care, losing their house, and they are not hearing how the Democratic Party is trying to solve that.” Latinos are expected to be the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc this fall, and Democrats have made it clear that they believe record turnout from the group will lead to significant victories in states that are crucial to recapturing the White House. Before the pandemic, many political operatives said they were seeing unprecedented levels of engagement and excitement from Latinos, in part driven by anger over what they view as the Trump administration’s damaging messages and policy on immigration. But many Latino operatives have repeatedly warned Democrats not to take these voters for granted. Presuming that anger with the Trump administration will easily translate into a victory for Mr. Biden is a mistake, they say. The concern, they argue, is an enthusiasm gap — less that Latinos will turn to Mr. Trump, but that they won’t vote at all. In a poll conducted in late February, 73 percent of Latino voters said they were “almost certain” to vote in November. Two months later, that number has dropped to 60 percent. “I don’t want anybody to take the Latino community of this country for granted, and we tend to do that,” said Henry Muñoz, a former Democratic Party official who helped start Somos, a network of health professionals in New York City, and who paid for the poll. “Latinos don’t vote because they don’t believe that anyone in office has their back. They don’t think that if they vote or if they organize, that anything that happens will impact their family.” Many Latino leaders have urged Mr. Biden’s campaign to learn from Senator Bernie Sanders. His primary campaign attracted widespread enthusiasm from Latino voters, particularly among young voters and in the West, where he won the California and Nevada nominating contests. The Sanders campaign invested early and heavily in attracting Latino voters, drawing on activists with longstanding ties to their local communities. “Sanders is the only presidential campaign that ever put their money where their mouth is and cleaned everybody else’s clock — that’s a lesson for everyone,” said Tony Cárdenas, a Democratic congressman from Los Angeles who has backed Mr. Biden and serves as the chairman of the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. “No campaign should ever think that just because somebody else has scapegoated the Latino community, that’s it — that in and of itself is not going to get it done.”  Biden campaign officials have assured Mr. Cárdenas and others that they will aggressively expand Latino outreach. Despite Mr. Trump’s relentless focus on immigration, the issue was never seen as a top priority for Democrats during the primary. Though the candidates roundly criticized the administration’s policies on family separations, few clearly articulated how they would handle vexing immigration policy questions as president. Immigration activists complained and interrupted several debates to draw more attention to the issue, and criticized Mr. Biden for his role in the Obama administration, which deported more than 2.5 million immigrants. Latino political leaders have long urged candidates to think beyond immigration when trying to appeal to Latino voters. And the pandemic has brought to the forefront many issues that have long been a focus for Latinos — inequality, access to health care, jobs and education. Marisa Franco, the executive director of Mijente, a Latino activist group that endorsed Mr. Sanders in the primary and has yet to officially back Mr. Biden, said she wanted to see the campaign do more to attract grass-roots support. “What the Sanders campaign really did was bring people in, who then went back into the neighborhoods where they are from, where they are trusted, and made a pitch that is much more compelling,” Ms. Franco said. “I think that’s what the Biden campaign hasn’t done and that’s something they will have to really grapple with.” The Trump campaign has frequently said that it plans to reach out to Latino voters, particularly in more conservative parts of the country. Even small inroads among those voters could help the campaign win states like Texas and Florida. “Many Latinos support President Trump because they understand that his policies actually help families like theirs,” said Ali Pardo, a spokeswoman for the campaign. “The president doesn’t make empty promises — he supercharged America’s economy once, and he will do it again.” Of course, no campaign in modern history has taken place amid a pandemic. Political organizers are trying to figure out how to adapt as people struggle with their own basic needs. And at a time when Mr. Trump is holding daily televised briefings, Mr. Biden is still figuring out how to break through to voters broadly. “Right now, President Trump is failing to give Americans the leadership they demand to solve the dual public health and economic crises that we are facing — which are hitting communities of color especially hard — and this poll shows that Latinos are paying attention,” said Cristóbal Alex, a senior adviser on the Biden campaign. “As we approach November, we will continue, and expand, our aggressive outreach in the Latino community to turn that vision into votes.”  Mr. Barreto said of the president, “Latino communities are being devastated right now, and Democrats have the chance to annihilate him on this.”  He added, “I think the worry for the Democrats is the perception that he appears to be managing is going unchallenged, and the longer that happens, the more damaging it is.”"
House to Examine Ouster of Health Official Who Doubted Drugs Trump Pushed,"WASHINGTON — A key House subcommittee chairwoman said on Thursday that she planned to hold hearings into the departure of Rick Bright, who said he was removed as the head of an agency involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine after he pressed for rigorous vetting of unproven drugs embraced by President Trump to combat the virus. “I know that life is difficult for members to travel, but we can’t let that get in the way and I’m sure that other members would want to be a part of a hearing as well,” said Representative Anna G. Eshoo, the chairwoman of the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee. Ms. Eshoo, a California Democrat, helped create the agency that Dr. Bright oversaw, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. The congresswoman spoke as Dr. Bright’s lawyers, in a statement, said that officials at the Health and Human Services Department, which BARDA is a part of, had made “demonstrably false” statements about Dr. Bright’s tenure, and that they planned to file whistle-blower complaints against the agency. Dr. Bright was abruptly dismissed this week from his BARDA post and as the department’s deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response, and was given a narrower job at the National Institutes of Health. In response, he issued a remarkable public statement accusing the Trump administration of putting cronyism over science, especially with two malaria drugs that the president has promoted as game changers in the treatment of the virus. Ms. Eshoo said that among the witnesses she would like to hear from are the secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, and an assistant secretary, Dr. Robert P. Kadlec, who supervised Dr. Bright. “I think the American people deserve to know what happened here, because all of our collective fate rested on” the development of a vaccine, she said. The Democratic chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, formally requested that the Health and Human Services Department’s inspector general also look into Dr. Bright’s removal and transfer. “Removing Dr. Bright in the midst of a pandemic would raise serious concerns under any circumstances, but his allegations that political considerations influenced this decision heighten those concerns and demand full accountability,” Mr. Pallone wrote. In his statement, Dr. Bright said: “Contrary to misguided directives, I limited the broad use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit. While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public.” Officials at the department have disputed Dr. Bright’s account and insisted there were problems with his management style. But they have so far refused to say so on the record. A performance review from September signed by Dr. Kadlec concluded, “Dr. Bright continues to lead change in BARDA with deftness and enthusiasm.” And in an internal email sent on Tuesday evening, Dr. Kadlec again offered praise as he described Dr. Bright’s new role in a “Shark Tank”-style effort to develop diagnostics related to the coronavirus, a collaboration between his former agency and the National Institutes of Health. “Rick brings extensive experience and expertise in facilitating powerful public-private partnerships that advance the health and well-being of the American people,” Dr. Kadlec wrote in the email. “Under Rick’s leadership, BARDA has made tremendous progress and with the skills and knowledge he has amassed across a long career in virology and, in particular, over the past four years as our BARDA director, I know he will drive and enable” the new effort. Ms. Eshoo said that she had worked with Dr. Bright and that he was “a thoroughbred professional.”“This is a terrible, swift sword that has come at science, and Dr. Bright,” she said. BARDA is a technical agency, established after the Sept. 11 attacks, that works to counter chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, as well as threats from pandemic influenza. It has flexibility to fund promising research and to team up with pharmaceutical companies to advance the development of countermeasures necessary to protect the health of the American public, with the aim of having the Food and Drug Administration approve them for inclusion in the national stockpile. Dr. Bright, a virologist, arrived at the agency when Barack Obama was president. He ran its anti-viral program, and was then promoted to other jobs, including heading the influenza and emerging infectious disease branch and working on the response to the Zika virus, before becoming its director in 2016. “This is the removal of somebody with a very clear scientific mind and good judgment,” said Marie-Paule Kieny, a French scientist and former official at the World Health Organization, who worked with Dr. Bright on developing vaccines for seasonal and pandemic influenza. “Rick is very reflective. He is not somebody who gets excited or screams. He looks at the evidence, he looks at the science and then he confers.” Like many career officials who worked under Mr. Obama, he was not greeted warmly by the Trump team. Officials at the Health and Human Services Department described Dr. Bright as difficult and high maintenance, despite the favorable review he had been given by Dr. Kadlec. And people familiar with the discussions said department officials had been talking about moving him out of his role for several months. In a statement on Wednesday night aimed at disputing Dr. Bright’s claim that he objected to the way the administration wanted to distribute chloroquines, a department spokeswoman said Dr. Bright had been the person who had put in for an emergency-use authorization with the Food and Drug Administration. A person familiar with Dr. Bright’s account said that was his compromise to get some regulations in place for how the drugs were used."
"Home Alone at the White House: A Sour President, With TV His Constant Companion","WASHINGTON — President Trump arrives in the Oval Office these days as late as noon, when he is usually in a sour mood after his morning marathon of television. He has been up in the White House master bedroom as early as 5 a.m. watching Fox News, then CNN, with a dollop of MSNBC thrown in for rage viewing. He makes calls with the TV on in the background, his routine since he first arrived at the White House. But now there are differences.The president sees few allies no matter which channel he clicks. He is angry even with Fox, an old security blanket, for not portraying him as he would like to be seen. And he makes time to watch Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s briefings from New York, closely monitoring for a sporadic compliment or snipe. Confined to the White House, the president is isolated from the supporters, visitors, travel and golf that once entertained him, according to more than a dozen administration officials and close advisers who spoke about Mr. Trump’s strange new life. He is tested weekly, as is Vice President Mike Pence, for Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The economy — Mr. Trump’s main case for re-election — has imploded. News coverage of his handling of the coronavirus has been overwhelmingly negative as Democrats have condemned him for a lack of empathy, honesty and competence in the face of a pandemic. Even Republicans have criticized Mr. Trump’s briefings as long-winded and his rough handling of critics as unproductive. His own internal polling shows him sliding in some swing states, a major reason he declared a temporary halt to the issuance of green cards to those outside the United States. The executive order — watered down with loopholes after an uproar from business groups — was aimed at pleasing his political base, people close to him said, and was the kind of move Mr. Trump makes when things feel out of control. Friends who have spoken to him said he seemed unsettled and worried about losing the election. But the president’s primary focus, advisers said, is assessing how his performance on the virus is measured in the news media, and the extent to which history will blame him. “He’s frustrated,” said Stephen Moore, an outside economic adviser to Mr. Trump who was the president’s pick to sit on the Federal Reserve Board before his history of sexist comments and lack of child support payments surfaced. “It’s like being hit with a meteor.” Mr. Trump frequently vents about how he is portrayed. He was enraged by an article this month in which his health secretary, Alex M. Azar II, was said to have warned Mr. Trump in January about the possibility of a pandemic. Mr. Trump was upset that he was being blamed while Mr. Azar was portrayed in a more favorable light, aides said. The president told friends that he assumed Mr. Azar was working the news media to try to save his own reputation at the expense of Mr. Trump’s. Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, disputed that the president’s focus was on his news coverage, but said in a statement that “President Trump’s highest priority is the health and safety of the American people.” Aides said the president’s low point was in mid-March, when Mr. Trump, who had dismissed the virus as “one person coming in from China” and no worse than the flu, saw deaths and infections from Covid-19 rising daily. Mike Lindell, a Trump donor campaign surrogate and the chief executive of MyPillow, visited the White House later that month and said the president seemed so glum that Mr. Lindell pulled out his phone to show him a text message from a Democratic-voting friend of his who thought Mr. Trump was doing a good job. Mr. Lindell said Mr. Trump perked up after hearing the praise. “I just wanted to give him a little confidence,” Mr. Lindell said. The Daily Briefings The daily White House coronavirus task force briefing is the one portion of the day that Mr. Trump looks forward to, although even Republicans say that the two hours of political attacks, grievances and falsehoods by the president are hurting him politically. Mr. Trump will hear none of it. Aides say he views them as prime-time shows that are the best substitute for the rallies he can no longer attend but craves. Mr. Trump rarely attends the task force meetings that precede the briefings, and he typically does not prepare before he steps in front of the cameras. He is often seeing the final version of the day’s main talking points that aides have prepared for him for the first time although aides said he makes tweaks with a Sharpie just before he reads them live. He hastily plows through them, usually in a monotone, in order to get to the question-and-answer bullying session with reporters that he relishes. The briefing’s critics, including Mr. Cuomo, have pointed out the obvious: With two hours of the president’s day dedicated to hosting what is still referred to as a prime-time news briefing, who is going to actually fix the pandemic? Even Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, one of the experts appointed to advise the president on the best way to handle the outbreak, has complained that the amount of time he must spend onstage in the briefings each day has a “draining” effect on him. They have the opposite effect on the president. How he arrived at them was almost an accident.Mr. Trump became enraged watching the coverage of his 10-minute Oval Office address in March that was rife with inaccuracies and had little in terms of action for him to announce. He complained to aides that there were few people on television willing to defend him. The solution, aides said, came two days later, when Mr. Trump appeared in the Rose Garden to declare a national emergency and answer questions from reporters. As he admonished journalists for asking “nasty” questions, Mr. Trump found the back-and-forth he had been missing. The virus had not been a perfect enemy — it was impervious to his browbeating — but baiting and attacking reporters energized him. “I don’t take responsibility at all,” Mr. Trump told White House correspondents in answer to one question. His first news conference in the briefing room took place the next day, on a Saturday, after Mr. Trump arrived unannounced in the Situation Room, wearing a polo shirt and baseball cap, and told the group he planned to attend the briefing and watch from a chair on the side. When aides told him that reporters would simply yell questions at him, even if he was not on the small stage, he agreed to take the podium. He has not looked back since. When Mr. Trump finishes up 90 or more minutes later, he heads back to the Oval Office to watch the end of the briefings on TV and compare notes with whoever is around from his inner circle. The New Pecking Order That circle has shrunk significantly as the president, who advisers say is more sensitive to criticism than at nearly any other point in his presidency, has come to rely on only a handful of longtime aides. Hope Hicks, a former communications director who rejoined the White House this year as counselor to the president, maintains his daily schedule. His former personal assistant, Johnny McEntee, now runs presidential personnel. Ms. Hicks and Mr. McEntee, along with Dan Scavino, the president’s social media guru who was promoted this week to deputy chief of staff for communications, provide Mr. Trump with a link to the better old days. The three are the ones outside advisers get in touch with to find out if it’s a good time to reach the president or pass on a message. Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump’s new chief of staff, is still finding his footing and adjusting to the nocturnal habits of Mr. Trump, who recently placed a call to Mr. Meadows, a senior administration official said, at 3:19 a.m. Mr. Meadows works closely with another trusted insider: Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and de facto chief of staff. “They have been really confined and figuratively imprisoned,” Matthew Dallek, a political historian at George Washington University, said about presidents who have kept close to the White House in times of crisis. While many officials have been encouraged to work remotely and the Old Executive Office Building is empty, the West Wing’s tight quarters are still packed. Mr. Pence and his top aides, usually stationed across the street, are working exclusively from the White House, along with most of the senior aides, who dine from the takeout mess while the in-house dining room remains closed. Few aides wear masks except for Matthew Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser, and some of his staff. The Day Ends as It Began As soon as he gets to the Oval Office, the president often receives his daily intelligence briefing, and Mr. Pence sometimes joins him. Then there are meetings with his national security team or economic advisers. Throughout the day, Mr. Trump calls governors, will have lunch with cabinet secretaries and pores over newspapers, which he treats like official briefing books and reads primarily in paper clippings that aides bring to him. He calls aides about stories he sees, either to order them to get a world leader on the phone or to ask questions about something he has read. Many friends said they were less likely to call Mr. Trump’s cellphone, assuming he does not want to hear their advice. Those who do reach him said phone calls have grown more clipped: Conversations that used to last 20 minutes now wrap up in three. Mr. Trump will still take calls from Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, on the latest on polling data. The president will in turn call Mr. Meadows and Kellyanne Conway about key congressional races. The president’s aides have slowly lined up more opportunities to keep him engaged. Last week, a small group of coronavirus survivors were led into the White House, and Mr. Trump took one of them to see the White House physician. Then Mr. Trump hosted a celebration of America’s truckers on the South Lawn. After he is done watching the end of the daily White House briefing — which is held seven days a week and sometimes goes as late as 8 p.m. — Mr. Trump watches television in his private dining room off the Oval Office. Assorted aides who are still around will join him to rehash the day and offer their assessments on the briefings. Comfort food — including French fries and Diet Coke — is readily available. Lately, aides say, his mood has started to brighten as his administration moves to open the economy. His new line, both in public and in private, is that there is reason to be optimistic. “And at the end of that tunnel, we see light,” Mr. Trump said in the Rose Garden last week.If he is not staying late in the West Wing, Mr. Trump occasionally has dinner with his wife, Melania Trump, and their son, Barron, who recently celebrated his 14th birthday at home. By the end of the day, Mr. Trump turns back to his constant companion, television. Upstairs in the White House private quarters — often in his own bedroom or in a nearby den — he flicks from channel to channel, reviewing his performance."
Treasury Clarifies Small-Business Loans as Fed Vows Transparency,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration moved on Thursday to ensure that large corporations with access to capital are not improperly taking emergency small-business loans and the Federal Reserve committed to greater immediate transparency about how its bailout funds are deployed, amid growing concerns about how hundreds of billions of dollars of economic relief money are being allocated. The actions came as Congress passed a $484 billion supplemental relief package to replenish an initial $349 billion program for small businesses, as well as providing more support for hospitals and expanding coronavirus testing capacity. The Paycheck Protection Program, which gives forgivable loans for small companies that keep workers on the payroll, has stirred controversy as big, well-connected companies received money before many smaller ones. With the government required to provide few details about those recipients, concern has increased that the Treasury Department is shrouding its programs in secrecy — and that the Fed, once its own trillion-dollar efforts are up and running, will do the same. On Thursday, the Treasury Department warned big publicly traded companies that they must prove they are in need of emergency small-business loans to keep their operations going and have no other option to receive financing or repay the funds. The department updated its “Frequently Asked Questions” page about the Paycheck Protection Program to urge “large companies with adequate sources of liquidity” to think twice before applying for small-business loans that are backed by the Small Business Administration. The Small Business Administration’s $349 billion fund to support these loans ran out last week and is expected to be replenished this week with another $310 billion. Anger over the program’s fairness has escalated as some big restaurant chains, including Shake Shack, received $10 million loans for their subsidiaries. The Treasury Department notes that by law, small-business loans are intended to be taken in cases when the money is “necessary to support the ongoing operations.” It said that borrowers needed to certify that requirement in “good faith” and take into account their ability to gain access to other sources of money, such as issuing stock or selling bonds. “For example, it is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith,” the department said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned businesses that they will be investigated and could face penalties if they improperly accept small-business money. He has urged businesses to return those funds. The guidance does not, however, force companies to return the money or accelerate repayments. It remains unclear how the Treasury Department or the Small Business Administration will pursue investigations of loans that were given to borrowers that should not have been eligible. For the loans to be fully forgiven, businesses are required to demonstrate to banks that they met requirements to maintain staffing levels for eight weeks. The documentation that they provide could be subject to audits by the Internal Revenue Service. The guidance released on Thursday said borrowers that repay loans in full by May 7 will be deemed by the Small Business Administration to have made their certifications in good faith, leaving them in good standing with the government. At least four public companies, Shake Shack, Kura Sushi USA, Ruth’s Hospitality Group and ItWorks, have said that they have already given back the funds from the Paycheck Protection Program. Sweetgreen, which is privately held, also said it had returned its $10 million loan. The Fed, which is infusing even more money into the financial system through its various facilities, said on Thursday that it would publicly disclose the names of companies that benefited from several of its lending programs. The Fed said it would also release the amount borrowed and interest rate charged as well as overall costs, revenues and fees on programs backed by Congress’s recent appropriations. The Fed Board will publish program reports on its website at least every 30 days, without blacking out the information. Congress has handed the Treasury Department $454 billion to support Fed lending facilities, which are meant to keep credit flowing through the financial system. Using that layer of taxpayer insurance, the Fed has announced programs that are meant to help midsize businesses, state governments, and large corporations. The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Mr. Mnuchin are required to regularly report to Congress on the programs, but it was unclear how much detail they would disclose publicly and in real time. “This is a significant victory for the public,” Bharat Ramamurti, the first member of the Congressional Oversight Commission responsible for overseeing the Fed programs, posted on Twitter after the release. “You will now know on a monthly basis which companies are getting support and how much support they’re getting.” The policy outlined on Thursday will apply to initiatives backed by new funding, according to the Fed. Those include two corporate bond-buying programs, a municipal bond-buying program and an effort to help midsize business. Those efforts are not underway. Programs meant to keep short-term markets functioning, which were announced and in some cases activated before the money was appropriated, will continue to report detailed information about participants on a delay. While the Fed must provide participant information to Congress while the programs are operating, the Dodd-Frank law only requires officials to make detailed disclosures public a year after the programs end. Fed officials have yet to decide which set of rules will apply to two of their programs — one that effectively buys bundles of consumer and business debt, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, and another that moves small business loans off bank balance sheets. Neither uses funding from the coronavirus relief bill, known as the CARES Act. “This seems to me like the Fed trying to pre-empt some of the issues that really plagued them in and around the financial crisis,” said Mark Spindel, who wrote a book about the Fed as a creature of Congress. “There’s no better way to be sensitive to the politics than to be open about who’s getting” the money.David Yaffe-Bellany contributed reporting from New York."
Your View of Staying Home,"By Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how un-unifying this pandemic feels.Typically, national crises bring the country together in a moment of shared sacrifice. That’s not what seems to be happening now. Republican-led states, like Georgia and Tennessee, are pushing to reopen earlier as states with Democratic governors, like Michigan, Virginia and New York, maintain more restrictive stay-at-home orders. Polling, always a lagging indicator of public opinion, is starting to reflect that schism: Two in five Republicans nationwide now say that the restrictions are causing more harm than good, an increase from last month. The reality, of course, is that pandemics are pernicious things. Germs don’t care about state lines, particularly in a country where people can travel far. But that’s not how the disease is being lived in America right now.In South Dakota, organizers of auto races expect hundreds of people to attend events this weekend. At the same time, in New York City, families are bracing for a bleak summer, with pools and camps already closed. These are two radically different approaches to an international problem.We wanted to know how you feel about the weeks of homebound living and whether you think it’s time to start opening up. Hundreds of you wrote to us. Most agreed with maintaining some — if not all — of the current restrictions. But a minority disagreed, raising concerns about everything from economic to mental health issues. As always, the responses have been edited and condensed. Here’s some of what you told us:Remember the emergency workersI work at a hospital in Fairfield County. People I see ignoring the guidelines on the news or in my travels have no idea of how bad the coronavirus is. Sometimes there is very little we can do to save these patients. Even the ones we send home from the E.R. are really sick and can take 2-3 weeks to recover. While the surge is diminishing there are still patients who are really slow to recover. I know everything seems fine wherever you look, but watch some hospital footage and listen to some registered nurse interviews, then decide if you want to skip the mask or congregate together.— Sean Vigneau, Fairfield, Connecticut If you give them an inch …Our much-less-than-enlightened mayor, who clearly drinks the Trump Kool-Aid daily, opened our beaches last Friday and earned national coverage. That has unwittingly given permission to folks to do horribly stupid things. The most egregious? I actually saw parents removing the yellow tape that the police had wrapped around the public park playground equipment — a playground that had signs on it saying that the equipment was not sanitized — and allowed their young children to play on it! I am so deeply angry that these shortsighted, selfish men are making decisions that put my health in danger, and that I have no control over it at all.— Lizanne Bomhard, Jacksonville Beach, Fla. ‘A form of house arrest’I am a divorced single mother trying to live on disability insurance, child support and the under-the-table hustles I do while my daughter is at school. Well, they closed the schools so I can’t work! Now they will be closed all the rest of the year too? That is wrong! This is a form of house arrest and I did not do anything! I have been a “yellow dog Democrat” my whole life and I have voted in every election since I turned 18, but this time, on this issue, I have to say that I agree with the conservatives! I have a right to work and the government is taking it away! I can’t pay my bills and already had to borrow from a friend for my car payment this month. We are hitting the food pantries and the pet food bank. If this doesn’t stop soon, my daughter and I will be homeless. It is just a fact of the math. And right now, the math looks really bad.— Joyce Chandler, Columbus, Ohio The 80-year-old perspective …While I really miss my golf, I think the economy should not be reopened until we get a vaccine or adequate testing and a tracking system. I do want to say it is easy for me to feel this way since I am 80 years old, retired, collecting social security and on Medicare. I am sure if I were 25 I would feel differently. So far, other than no golf or restaurants, life has been pretty normal. Tough getting into Costco, except on senior days: Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m. — Cliff Shepard, Camarillo, Calif. … and the younger viewI do not think that the U.S. should open for at least two more months. I am only in high school which doesn’t really give me the best credentials, but as I see other schools ending for the year it makes me very concerned. Once we open back up it is very likely that people are going to want to get together again and have parties. Even if this is restricted, people will find a way. Everyone wants to see their friends and family, and opening before we are certain sounds pretty dumb to me.— Maggie Richards, Ithaca, N.Y. Think about the rural areas …My husband and I live in the northern part of the state, near Sandpoint, Idaho. It’s a resort area with a beautiful lake and miles of mountain trails in Forest Service areas. We have had only four cases of the virus reported as of this date, but many people are not practicing social distancing. We are concerned about people traveling from both Washington and Montana for recreation. There are approximately 45,000 people in this county and our hospital has 25 beds with only four I.C.U. rooms. The hospital does not have enough P.P.E. and asked local residents to sew handmade masks.— Connie Burkhart, Hope, Idaho ‘Inconvenient and costly’Outside of the tristate hot zone, Covid-19 is a different experience. The dire hospital situation on the news is only a tristate problem. No one on my street, and none of my friends, nor anyone all those people know, has tested positive for coronavirus. So far, for us, it’s a TV show. One that is really inconvenient and costly. As a Democrat, I fear we have damaged our chances at retaining the House by overreacting to what will turn out to be a very expensive miscalculation on the coronavirus fatality rate, and thus the need for the job-killing lockdown.— David Bates, Dexter, Mich. Scared about public healthI’m a new small business in downtown Omaha. I opened my bridal shop a year ago and as I enter into month two with my doors closed, it’s hard to know what the future holds. Nebraska is one of the few states without a stay-at-home order, and it’s honestly frightening. So much has changed, but it feels like the majority of people are going about life as normal. I’m worried that we will become a hot spot. I still have competitors with their doors open. I’m not sure how they are managing business at a safe distance, and surface contamination, but our governor has not mandated any of us to close. It’s quite frightening and disappointing to be honest.— Rachel Campbell, Omaha Scared about the economyAs long as the reopening is staged and science-based I think it should start within a couple of weeks. People forget that the virus is not going to go away until and unless there is a vaccine. At best we are going to have rolling spots and times when Covid-19 will recur. When that happens there will be a need to ramp up the social distancing again in a measured and localized manner, depending on how it recurs. We will all live in poverty and ruin if we wait for this to go away. Failure to keep the economy as healthy as possible will devastate the country and the many lives that depend upon at least a moderately healthy system.— Rev. Dr. Robert Holaday, Littlefield, Texas ‘Frustrating AF’It’s frustrating AF seeing people still believing and trusting the government to be doing their job let alone the right thing. We have one enemy, Covid-19. Yet some leaders resisting and going against stay-at-home orders are not only dangerous to everyone, but annoying. The more disobedient people are, the longer this mess is a mess. I feel thankful, yet terrible, for our front-line essential workers, across every industry. Because everyone that isn’t doing their part, their civic duty, to stay inside, to be conscious of their hygiene and health, is literally giving a big middle finger to everyone else. This is bigger than you. This is the quickest, dirtiest virus that can wipe out economies, healthy people, vulnerable people, children, elderly, etc., it doesn’t matter. So the best thing you can do, is cozy up. Do whatever has been on your personal to-do list. Or don’t do anything. This last week felt a little tougher than usual. Yet it doesn’t change how quickly Covid-19 is revenging across the world. Country to country, city to airport, doorknob to person.— Catherine Tran, San Francisco  Drop us a line!

From Opinion: Campaigning and the Veepstakes Though sometimes it might not seem like it, with few rallies, and no door knocking or much of any political organizing of any kind — there’s a presidential election this year. And an incumbent’s advantage — using the trappings of the office of president (like Air Force One and the Oval Office) as a backdrop in re-election-seeking behavior — has taken on a new form. As Times columnist Charles Blow writes, “for over a month now, the White House has been holding its daily coronavirus briefings,” from the White House Rose Garden or press briefing room. These briefings, Blow says, have “simply become a replacement for his political rallies,” conveying “misinformation, deceptions, rage, blaming and boasting.” The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Joe Biden, faces the traditional hurdles of the insurgent — but there’s still much he can do to energize national attention, even when the traditional means of retail engagement, like door knocking and rallying, must wait. He can choose his vice-presidential running mate, as Times columnists Gail Collins and Bret Stephens suggest. They discuss the prospect of Senators Amy Klobuchar or Elizabeth Warren, or Governors Gina Raimondo or Gretchen Whitmer, joining Mr. Biden on the ticket.

House Passes Relief for Small Businesses and Aid for Hospitals and Testing,"WASHINGTON — The House gave resounding approval on Thursday to a $484 billion coronavirus relief package to restart a depleted loan program for distressed small businesses and to provide funds for hospitals and coronavirus testing, and it moved to ramp up oversight of the sprawling federal response to the pandemic. President Trump said he would quickly sign the measure — the latest installment in a government aid program that is approaching $3 trillion — which passed with broad bipartisan support even as some liberal Democrats condemned it for being too stingy. But the fight over what should be included foreshadowed a pitched partisan battle to come over the next round of federal relief, which is likely to center on aid to states and cities facing dire financial straits. At the White House, Mr. Trump, who said he was “grateful” that Congress had cleared the bill, said the issue of funding for struggling states was “probably going to be the next thing on the list.” Even as they dispensed with another nearly half-trillion taxpayer dollars, Democrats were moving to scrutinize the administration’s handling of the funds. Just before the aid package passed, they pushed through a measure creating a special House subcommittee to investigate the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and the array of federal spending measures enacted to address it, defying objections from Mr. Trump and Republicans. “We have our differences, but we are coming together on this particular bill,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who appeared on the House floor wearing a cream-colored scarf she used as a face covering on Thursday as she moved around the Capitol, where most lawmakers and staff aides wore masks to guard against spreading the virus. “I’m proud of that. It is bipartisan, it is urgent, and let us get on with it so that we can get on to supporting our heroes in a way that is worthy of their sacrifice.” The package that passed on Thursday by a vote of 388 to 5 was an interim step after enactment of the $2.2 trillion stimulus law. It emerged from a flurry of negotiations between Democrats and the Trump administration after funding lapsed for the Paycheck Protection Program, a small-business loan program created by the stimulus plan that had been overwhelmed by demand the instant it started. The measure replenished that program, providing $320 billion for it, but at the insistence of Democrats who demanded additional funds and policy changes, it also included $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing — plus a mandate that the Trump administration come up with a strategy for helping states deploy and gain access to tests across the country. Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, chastised Democrats for what he described as obstruction, saying that “the cruel result is less assistance and more anxiety for workers, families and small businesses.” “Democrats need to stop the gamesmanship and get back to putting Americans first,” he added.The vote took place in a House chamber transformed by the pandemic. Most congressional officials and lawmakers covered their faces with blue surgical masks or fabrics in an array of colors, patterns and — in the case of at least one member — glitter. In between votes that slowed to a crawl to allow for social distancing, more than a dozen staff members wearing orange gloves and masks rushed to clean the chamber with disinfecting sprays and wipes, scrubbing armrests, banisters and microphones before lawmakers returned. Multiple lawmakers who had previously had to isolate outside Washington after testing positive or being exposed to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, returned to vote. Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, her voice cracking with emotion, said that she was dedicating the bill to her sister, who was dying of the virus in a St. Louis hospital. Congressional officials and representatives took unusual precautions. Lawmakers filtered through the chamber in smaller groups to cast their votes — prolonging the voting period to about 90 minutes compared with the usual 15 — and boxes of gloves and surgical masks were set outside the chamber doors, which remained open so that those coming and going would not have to touch them. During the debate, a few lawmakers wandered up to the gallery above, typically reserved for the public, to witness the spectacle. Democratic leaders had initially planned to push through a historic modification to House rules that would allow for remote voting, but they postponed the move amid opposition from Republicans, who have begun clamoring for the chamber to resume business as usual, echoing calls from conservatives around the country. “I have always believed that whenever possible, any changes to our rules should be bipartisan,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the House Rules Committee, who will examine the issue with other top Republicans and Democrats. “However, the status quo is unacceptable and dangerous, not just to members of Congress, but, more importantly, to everyone we come in contact with.” Among those taking precautions on the floor was Ms. Pelosi, who carefully wiped down the lectern and removed her scarf from her face each time she delivered remarks. She donned purple latex gloves to carefully write her vote to form the select committee on a green card. Progressive Democrats voiced strong opposition to the aid package, saying that it was woefully insufficient. Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, said it would have been “indefensible” for Congress to fail to restore funding for the small-business program, “but it’s also indefensible for us not to focus on replenishing the coffers of Americans, and focus on making sure they are able to support paying their rent, making sure that our cities and states aren’t going bankrupt, and making sure that American families aren’t dying of hunger.” Nearly two dozen liberal groups, including Indivisible and Justice Democrats — the group that helped start the campaign of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York — wrote a letter to House Democrats urging them to stop “unnecessarily giving away leverage that people depend on you to use in order to save lives.” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who has said the measure was far too small and should include aid to struggling states and cities, was the sole Democrat who opposed the bill. Four Republicans voted no, while Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, the chamber’s lone independent, voted present. And while most Republicans supported the bill, many took the opportunity to urge Congress to return to its routine business in Washington and warned that they would not be agreeing to any more huge relief packages negotiated among top Democrats and the administration with little input from rank-and-file lawmakers. “Today, I’m holding my nose voting for a bill I had no chance to shape,” declared Representative Chip Roy, Republican of Texas. “But this is it, Madam Speaker — enough,” he said, adding, “No more half-assed legislating.” (The presiding speaker at the time, Representative Kathy Castor, Democrat of Florida, later warned against vulgarity in the chamber.) Republicans also resisted the creation of the oversight panel, which will have the power to subpoena documents and witnesses, unanimously opposing it in a party-line vote of 212 to 182. The committee is charged with examining the coronavirus relief packages enacted over the past two months, and scrutinizing “preparedness for and response to the coronavirus crisis.” That includes deployment of testing and containment, the distribution of equipment and medical supplies and the development of a treatment. “We are talking about how this money is spent as we go forward,” Ms. Pelosi said. “This isn’t about assigning blame. This is about taking responsibility.” Mr. Trump does not see it that way. Last month, when Ms. Pelosi announced she would form the panel, he dismissed it as a partisan “witch hunt.” Republicans fought the committee’s creation, with leaders actively encouraging rank-and-file lawmakers to vote against it on Thursday, and it is unclear whether they will participate. The panel is to be led by Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat, and will have up to six other Democrats, as well as five Republicans. Mr. McCarthy said on Wednesday that he had told Ms. Pelosi that he considered the committee redundant, and would wait to appoint members until he saw which Democrats she selected. “This committee will be the only committee weighted politically,” Mr. McCarthy said on Thursday on the floor. “The public does not want to see politics. Why would we waste our time bringing people back to create a political committee?” The stimulus law enacted last month established a three-pronged structure to oversee the carrying out of the legislation, at the insistence of Democrats who blocked its passage until they could build in accountability measures. Under that law, a special inspector general within the Treasury Department, a committee of inspectors general and a congressional oversight commission are all tasked with examining how the money is spent. But that oversight has been slow to take shape. Mr. Trump moved to oust the leader of the committee of inspectors general, removing Glenn A. Fine, who had been the acting inspector general for the Defense Department and set to lead the new Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. As of Friday, the Congressional Oversight Commission had four of its five members, with Ms. Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, yet to announce who will lead it. Congressional leaders have selected Bharat Ramamurti, a former aide to Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts; Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania; Representative French Hill, Republican of Arkansas; and Representative Donna E. Shalala, Democrat of Florida. Ms. Shalala has faced calls for her resignation from the board after The Miami Herald reported that she failed to properly disclose stock sales in 2019, which she apologized for. But a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi said that Ms. Shalala retained “the speaker’s complete confidence as she works to hold the administration accountable” and that she had been working with the House Ethics Committee to address the issues with her personal investments.Catie Edmondson contributed reporting."
Financial Aid to Struggling States Is Next Big Congressional Battle,"WASHINGTON — With congressional approval of the latest emergency pandemic measure sealed on Thursday, the focus is quickly shifting to an escalating battle over whether Congress will provide hundreds of billions of dollars to states staggering under the costs of the coronavirus outbreak. Anxious governors on the front lines of battling the pandemic have been clamoring for more federal help, saying their budgets are being stretched to the breaking point and their revenues are collapsing as they pour resources into health care while their economies are shut down. But the latest measure contained no new state aid, as Republicans resisted extending help even as state officials described their situations as increasingly dire. “Many states are already reporting precipitous declines in revenues that fund state services in health care, education, public safety, transportation and other vital programs,” members of the National Governors Association wrote to congressional leaders this week. “States and local governments need robust support from the federal government as we navigate the response to this pandemic and to help foster the economic recovery that is ahead.” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, alarmed and angered state officials on Wednesday when he said he wanted to approach the next round of pandemic legislation more deliberately. He said he was opposed to shipping money to state governments if they were going to apply it to fiscal problems unrelated to the pandemic, such as shoring up underfunded pension plans for public workers. Rather than looking for handouts, Mr. McConnell said states, which shared $150 billion allocated in previous pandemic legislation, should consider filing for bankruptcy. His aides threw fuel on the fire in a news release that said the Senate leader was opposed to “Blue State Bailouts,” suggesting it was Democratic-leaning states that were seeking the money to take care of problems caused by fiscal mismanagement. Those comments prompted a sharp backlash, including from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, a Democrat, who lashed out at Mr. McConnell for a second day on Thursday. Mr. Cuomo has consistently said that federal funding was desperately needed to get the state back on its feet and seemed gobsmacked by the concept that it should even consider declaring bankruptcy, noting New York’s position as the nation’s financial services center. “That’s how you’re going to bring this national economy back?” asked an incredulous Mr. Cuomo, who called Mr. McConnell irresponsible and reckless. “You want to see that market fall through the cellar? Let New York State declare bankruptcy.” In a virtual interview sponsored by Politico, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican who heads the National Governors Association, said he expected that Mr. McConnell would come to regret his remarks and noted that the Trump administration had been supportive of state assistance. “I’m hopeful that we are going to, between the administration and the 55 governors in America, including territories, we are going to convince Senator McConnell that maybe he shouldn’t let the states go bankrupt,” said Mr. Hogan, who said his state would soon face a $2.8 billion shortfall. President Trump gave ambivalent signals at his White House briefing on Thursday, suggesting that he might be open to offering aid to the states, but also saying, “It is interesting that the states that are in trouble do happen to be blue.” He singled out Illinois, and said many states had been in financial trouble long before “the plague.” States are facing severe financial strain, as sales tax revenues dry up amid quarantines that have shuttered restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and nail salons. That pain has been compounded by the number of people losing their jobs and filing for state unemployment benefits. Another 4.4 million people filed for unemployment on last week and, while the federal government is kicking in an extra $600 per beneficiary, states must pay the bulk of unemployment benefits using trust funds that are already running low. “Most state trust funds are underfunded for this crisis,” said Jared Walczak, the director of state tax policy at the Tax Foundation. “It’s hard not to be. The magnitude of this crisis meant that very few states were prepared.” At least three states — California, New York and Ohio — are expected to deplete their trust funds within two weeks, with Kentucky, Texas and Massachusetts close behind. Once those funds run out, the states can borrow money from the federal government, but must repay it within two years. Republicans on Capitol Hill say they believe Mr. McConnell, who opposed new state aid in talks that produced the most recent measure, was trying to reassure restive conservatives that he would not give easily on more funding in upcoming talks after Congress has already allocated about $2.7 trillion in deficit spending in response the emergency. But he faces significant obstacles if he intends to block the aid, and most see that as an unlikely outcome given the extent of bipartisan support for more state relief. Not only do Democrats in the House and the Senate strongly support state aid — it was one concession Democrats were unable to wring out of Republicans in the latest round — but many Republicans have made it clear they do as well. Several have signed on to bipartisan bills and letters calling for the aid. Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, has joined Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, in drafting legislation providing $500 billion sought by the states. After Senate approval of the legislation on Tuesday, Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, called for shoring up the states as well. “I believe we need to do more to help state and local governments affected by this crisis, and I believe the next package should provide additional assistance,” he said, also calling for increased flexibility from the administration on how states can spend the money. Lawmakers say the latest round of funding could again run out in a matter of days, opening the door to calls for another rescue measure and beginning the struggle over aid to the states in earnest. While many Republicans back the state relief, top aides said that most would join Mr. McConnell in balking at the idea that it could be applied to a pension bailout and that a compromise could include strict prohibitions on how the money is spent. A top state lawmaker in Illinois last week included a request for $10 billion in pension relief in the state’s appeal for federal help, though the problems long preceded the pandemic. Many state and municipal pension systems have been underwater since the dot-com crash of 2001, when much of their funding from the booming 1990s melted away. Their problems worsened substantially during the market crash of 2008. Investment losses that year and in 2009 prompted officials in a number of states to attempt pension overhauls in the hope of making their plans sustainable. They were promptly sued by retirees and public workers’ unions, who cited state laws and constitutional provisions that make it illegal to tamper with public pension plans. The pension problem is not unique to red states or blue. Illinois, a steadfast Democratic stronghold, is seen by experts as the state with the most intractable pension problems. But in Kentucky, Mr. McConnell’s home state, the pension system is in nearly as grave danger as the one in Illinois.Mary Williams Walsh and Jesse McKinley contributed reporting."
"In Wisconsin, Virus Creates New Front in Long-Simmering Partisan Wars","Wisconsin had barely finished its fight over whether to hold an election in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic before America’s foremost battleground state began another political brawl over the pandemic itself. Officials from both parties rushed to familiar corners this week, with Democrats rallying behind Gov. Tony Evers’s decision to extend the state’s stay-home ordinance through May 26, while Republicans are stoking anger over what they depict as an assault on civil liberties. Wisconsin’s decade-long partisan war will once again be on display Friday, as right-wing protesters prepare to mass outside the State Capitol in Madison to assail Mr. Evers and the restrictions he put in place to curb the spread of the virus. Thousands of people have indicated on Facebook that they will attend, making it potentially the largest gathering so far in a nationwide series of protests against stay-at-home restrictions. Republicans, in need of a show of force after badly losing a State Supreme Court contest this month, have sued Mr. Evers to block the extension, discussed removing his public health secretary and, in recent days, amplified protesters’ calls to reopen the state while covertly helping to coordinate the Madison rally and other satellite gatherings across the state. The planned protests on Friday, along with smaller events last weekend, have focused attention on the thorny issues governors face as they grapple with the decision over when to ease restrictions, with President Trump alternately encouraging protests calling for states to reopen and warning about the health risks of doing so. And in Wisconsin, a state critical to both Mr. Trump and the presumptive Democratic nominee, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the demonstrations serve as a stand-in for the general election battle to come. “This seems to have become a proxy war for the state Republican Party and it does have a zombie Tea Party feel to it,” said Charlie Sykes, a longtime conservative talk radio host in Milwaukee who left the airwaves at the end of 2016 and has since turned against Trump-era Republicans. “This will energize them to think that they’re back on the offensive. They didn’t miss a beat from losing that Supreme Court election and this all seems about mobilizing and firing up the base.” The legal challenge to Mr. Evers’s extension follows a similar effort in early April, when Republicans led by Robin Vos, the speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, successfully petitioned the State Supreme Court to block the governor’s order to move the election date as well as an effort to switch to an all-mail election. Mr. Vos, in an interview, portrayed the uprising against Mr. Evers as a broad response among Wisconsinites that crossed party lines. “It’s not just Republicans,” he said. “It’s a whole lot of people who own a small businesses and they’re unemployed and there’s no reason they can’t work.” Vicki McKenna, a conservative talk radio host who has promoted the rallies on her program, said she hoped they inspired county sheriffs and local public health departments to defy the governor’s coronavirus orders. “You go to central and northern Wisconsin, you have folks who are looking at Milwaukee and saying, ‘We understand that they need help, but why do we have to sacrifice our entire livelihood for them?’” she said. While deep anger is growing on the right, there is some evidence that the Republican stance on the coronavirus is repelling voters Mr. Trump will need to carry the state in November. Future Now Fund, a progressive organization that focuses on state legislative races, found in a study that in this month’s State Supreme Court race, Wisconsin counties with higher coronavirus infection rates saw larger shifts to the liberal candidate than did counties with lower rates. The shifts occurred in both urban and rural counties. “Experiencing coronavirus can push people beyond their tribal lane to a different engagement with politics,” said Daniel Squadron, the co-founder and executive director of Future Now Fund. And Democrats’ private polling in Wisconsin conducted after the election but before the protests began found 72 percent of Wisconsinites approved of how Mr. Evers has handled the coronavirus response. The same poll found Mr. Trump’s coronavirus job approval in the state was 51 percent. “They can try to do this ‘We’re going to play to our base’ thing,” said Sachin Chheda, a Milwaukee Democratic operative who ran the Supreme Court campaign for the victorious liberal candidate, Jill Karofsky. “It’s bad politics. They might get some short-term wins, but it isn’t going to help them win in November.” The organizers of the Madison rally and the two others held last weekend have gone to great lengths to describe themselves and their events as nonpolitical, despite ample evidence that the state’s Republican leadership is intricately involved. They are also trying to prevent the gatherings from becoming a platform for other conservative causes, or from appearing like de facto Trump campaign rallies. Brian Westrate, the treasurer of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, posted to a private Facebook group for organizers and some attendees of the Madison rally, asking people not to bring emblems of causes other than resisting the stay-at-home order. “Ok folks, I implore you, please leave Confederate flags and/or AR15s, AK47s, or any other long guns at home,” Mr. Westrate wrote. “I well understand that the Confederacy was more about states rights than slavery. But that does not change the truth of how we should try to control the optics during the event.” In an interview, Mr. Westrate acknowledged writing the post and said it may be futile to ask the rally participants to limit the variety of their political motivations. “Ideally, people should leave Trump stuff at home,” he said. “But you can’t hold a rally in favor of the First Amendment and then become over-draconian in terms of telling people how to dress.” At two rallies last weekend, in the conservative Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield and the rural town of Mosinee, protesters carried Confederate flags, waved Trump signs and toted firearms, according to attendees and news photographs of the gatherings. Cory Tomczyk, who hosted the Mosinee rally on the grounds of his industrial recycling company — which provides raw materials to companies making paper products — said he hoped the protests served as a conservative resistance in the same way that the state’s liberals were galvanized by Gov. Scott Walker’s 2011 move to end collective bargaining rights for the state’s public employees. “People have this image in their head that they’re going to make it look like the protest for Act 10,” Mr. Tomczyk said, referring to the uprising against Mr. Walker’s labor law. “I don’t know if it will look like that, but I hope it will.” With Ms. McKenna and others in the state’s powerful network of conservative talk radio hosts promoting the rally daily, the event will likely draw scores of Republican elected officials on hand to lend their support, but perhaps not dominating the stage. Shae Sortwell, a Republican state representative from Manitowoc County, said his caucus’s G.O.P. leadership suggested members not speak at the rally to try to make sure it comes across as “a citizen-led effort.” Mr. Sortwell said he had no qualms about attending the rally. “Do we want to take away what people have to live for in the sole pursuit of one singular goal of additional survival,” Mr. Sortwell said. “Is it safe, is it unsafe? I don’t know.” Adrianne Melby, a social media marketer for a Racine County chiropractic firm who is one of the planners of the Madison rally, said organizers had sought to portray the event as homegrown and apolitical. She said they turned down a donor’s offer to help pay for the event, though Ms. Melby declined to say who made the offer. Wisconsin’s State Capitol Police on Monday denied the Madison group’s official permit request. Mr. Evers’s spokeswoman, Melissa Baldauff, said there would not be an effort to stop people from gathering outside the Capitol — they just would not be allowed inside the building. Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway of Madison said she would not use the city’s police department to force protesters to disperse. “All indications are that these are manufactured protests,” Ms. Rhodes-Conway said. “They are seeking attention. I think they are getting more attention than they deserve.” One prominent dissenter among the state’s Republicans is Senator Ron Johnson, who rose from being the chief executive of a plastic manufacturer to winning a Senate seat in the 2010 Tea Party wave. Mr. Johnson said he wouldn’t criticize the governor’s stewardship of the pandemic response, adding that concerns about the economic impact should not lead Wisconsinites to disavow public health guidance. “I’m not going to gather in crowds,” said Mr. Johnson, who said he is donning a mask when he goes grocery shopping near his home in Oshkosh. “I have enough fear and respect of this illness that I’m not going to do that myself. I’m not encouraging anybody to do it.” Still, few people wore masks or other protective equipment at the weekend rallies. And Mr. Vos, who wore body-length personal protective equipment during his shift as a poll monitor in his hometown, Burlington, on April 7, declined to say in an interview whether it is safe for thousands of people to gather in protest at the State Capitol. “I’m not a doctor,” Mr. Vos said. “I don’t give advice to people on how surgery should be done. I think people should make their own choices.”Lisa Lerer and Lauren Justice contributed reporting"
"Donald Reed Herring, Brother of Elizabeth Warren, Dies of Coronavirus","This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. Donald Reed Herring, the oldest brother of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, died of Covid-19 on Tuesday in Norman, Okla. He was 86. Ms. Warren confirmed the death on Twitter on Thursday, “What made him extra special was his smile — quick and crooked, it always seemed to generate its own light, one that lit up everyone around him,” Ms. Warren wrote. “I’m grateful to the nurses and front-line staff who took care of him, but it’s hard to know that there was no family to hold his hand or to say ‘I love you’ one more time — and no funeral for those of us who loved him to hold each other close.” Mr. Herring was born on June 11, 1933, to Donald and Pauline (Reed) Herring. He was a career officer in the Air Force, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel, and flew combat missions in Vietnam before retiring from the military in 1973 and starting an auto-detailing business. In addition to Ms. Warren, he is survived by his wife, Judith Anne Hart; two sons, John and Jeffrey; and two brothers, David and John Herring. His first wife, Nancy, died of cancer. Ms. Warren spoke about her brothers frequently during her presidential campaign — often noting their military service and that two of the three were Republicans — and they appeared prominently in one of her campaign ads."
On Politics: ‘Politics and Cronyism Ahead of Science’,"Good morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday. Where things standIs President Trump putting “politics and cronyism ahead of science”? Those were the words chosen by Rick Bright, the doctor who had been leading the federal effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine. This week he was removed from that position at the Department of Health and Human Services and reassigned to a narrower role at the National Institutes of Health, Bright said. He had resisted Trump’s efforts to direct government money toward hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that some have pushed as a viable coronavirus treatment despite a lack of thorough vetting by medical researchers. Bright says he thinks this is what led to his ouster.“I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,” Bright said in a statement to The Times. Although it did not name Trump directly, the letter made clear Bright’s dissatisfaction with how he had been treated by the administration, even before he was removed from his post. “I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science — not politics or cronyism — has to lead the way,” he said.When the House votes on a $484 billion relief package today, it will do so in person — since there is no provision in the congressional rule book allowing for voting in absentia. Speaker Nancy Pelosi had originally hoped to change that by having the House vote on a new policy that would permit future votes to be conducted remotely. It would have been the first time in the history of Congress that lawmakers were allowed to cast votes remotely. But Republicans objected, saying that Democratic leadership had not consulted them enough and insisting that their goal remained to swiftly reopen Congress for regular business. “We’ve been through war and others, and this body has still been able to meet,” said Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leader. “Whatever we do, when it comes to voting and others, should be bipartisan.” But a compromise could be in the offing. McCarthy and Pelosi had an hourlong phone call on Wednesday, and agreed to convene a group of lawmakers from both parties to plan how the House will conduct its business as the pandemic continues.In New York City, which has recorded over 10,000 virus-related deaths, the City Council has unveiled a broad virus relief package aimed at helping workers, renters, homeless people and small businesses. The proposal includes a “bill of rights” for workers that provides paid sick leave for so-called gig laborers and prevents essential workers from being fired without cause. The legislation also seeks to give New Yorkers affected by the virus more time to make rent payments by preventing city officials from stepping in to collect rental debts or carry out evictions until next April. Corey Johnson, the speaker and a sponsor of the bill, has said the council is pursuing a more ambitious plan to cancel rents for those affected by the virus-related shutdown. But the legislation that the council discussed yesterday, in a videoconference session, is meant as a more short-term measure. Still, it puts the city near the forefront of municipal efforts nationwide to address tenants’ rights and poverty issues badly exacerbated by the pandemic. Photo of the day President Trump and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, during Wednesday’s daily briefing.  A new poll shows a dip in Republican support for stay-at-home orders.Even as some Republican governors take steps to reopen their states’ economies, most Americans remain wary of the virus’s threat and are willing to stay home to stop its spread, polls show. But a shift in sentiment is occurring, particularly among Republicans — most of whom now say the worst is most likely behind us, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll released today. While 51 percent of Americans said they thought the worst days of the pandemic still lay ahead, including nearly two-thirds of Democrats, a slim majority of Republicans said the opposite. That represents a change from late March, when another Kaiser poll found that two-thirds of Republicans expected things to get worse before getting better. When it comes to shelter-in-place restrictions, most Americans in the new poll said they remained worthwhile; that was true across party lines. Even in states with Republican governors — who have generally been more willing to entertain lifting restrictions, and eight of whom never ordered statewide limitations at all — support remains relatively high for stay-at-home orders, regardless of respondents’ party affiliation. Yet two in five Republicans nationwide now say that these kinds of restrictions are an unnecessary burden and are causing more harm than good. That makes Republicans more than twice as likely as independents — and exponentially more likely than Democrats — to express disillusionment with the restrictions. Governors in some Southern states announced plans this week to begin lifting the restrictions on social distancing, though federal health officials have consistently said this could lead to a resurgence of the virus. Demonstrators, often with backing from conservative interest groups, have taken to the streets in various other states to protest the stay-at-home orders. The mixed feelings of everyday Republicans reflected in the Kaiser poll are mirrored by the conflicting messages coming from national and state leaders. Trump has repeatedly encouraged governors to make their own decisions on when to reopen, and he has said he hopes that it can happen soon. But after Brian Kemp, the governor of Georgia, announced plans this week to reopen, Trump criticized him, saying, “I think it’s too soon.” On Politics is also available as a newsletter.

"As Coronavirus Threatens, Teenage Migrants ‘Age Out’ Into ICE Jails","WASHINGTON — Isaac, a 17-year-old Guatemalan, crossed the U.S. border nearly eight months ago and was detained as a minor by the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement, long before the novel coronavirus existed. As his 18th birthday approached last month, it appeared he would be released to a Texas shelter where the director promised that the teenager would be “provided counseling and referred for any medical assistance he may require” for high blood pressure, severe anxiety and, if necessary, Covid-19, should the virus reach the shelter. Instead, on the day he became an adult in the eyes of the U.S. government, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement swooped in and shipped him to the Otero County Processing Center in El Paso, where he says he sleeps arm’s distance away from dozens of other immigrants. “I have no doctor. I have medication but it is one given to me in the previous shelter, when I was a minor,” said Isaac, who asked to be identified only by his middle name for fear of retaliation. Around 32,000 migrants remain in custody on civil charges as ICE faces growing pressure to address the health concerns posed by the spreading coronavirus, including scores like Isaac who were initially taken into custody as minors, then held long enough to age into the adult detention center. As of Wednesday night, ICE had confirmed 287 cases of the virus among detainees and 35 cases among staff members. Earlier this year, lawyers representing two migrants argued in a class-action suit that the Department of Homeland Security and ICE had violated a statute that mandates how migrant children should be protected by relying on dubious technology and the discretion of individual local field offices. As a result, instead of minors going to a group home, they are ending up in ICE jails. The administration’s system of deciding where to place such “age outs” exemplifies the extent of President Trump’s hard-line immigration policies. Those moves include an executive order signed on Wednesday that restricts legal immigration into the United States and obscure procedural maneuvers like age-out detentions that not only limit opportunities to claim refuge in the country but also could expose a vulnerable population to the pandemic. The Education Department this week even prohibited higher education institutions from offering emergency assistance to undocumented students who were brought to the United States as children and are currently protected from deportation. The coronavirus has re-energized the president’s immigration efforts, even as it brings new scrutiny. A federal judge in California this week ordered ICE to review the cases of detainees at high risk of catching the virus, including those over the age of 55. But the coronavirus has also amplified concerns over the already contentious — and possibly illegal — practice of moving young migrants like Isaac on their 18th birthday from relatively benign shelters managed by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement into the Department of Homeland Security’s ICE detention centers. While the safest option for the teenagers would be to be released to a sponsor, immigration lawyers say the shelters and group homes would provide more space and care than the detention facilities, where they say the young migrants would be mixed with another contingent population and be exposed to the virus, as well as psychological harm. “Our clients are terrified of the prospect of being transferred to a secured detention facility with large numbers of people in close, confined settings, which is in direct contravention with C.D.C.’s advice on how to save oneself from this pandemic,” said Anthony Enriquez, the director of the unaccompanied minors program at Catholic Charities, who is representing another teenager in New York who in recent weeks was handcuffed by ICE agents on his 18th birthday and moved to a detention center. “This is a real recipe for a humanitarian disaster,” Mr. Enriquez said.Beyond the health risks are legal questions: A federal judge in the District of Columbia will soon rule on whether the Trump administration’s age-out effort violates the law. By choosing to detain teenagers instead of releasing them to group homes or sponsors, lawyers argue, the administration has violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which requires the government to consider “the least restrictive setting available” to the migrants. In Houston, ICE agents placed 97 percent of teenagers transferred from the resettlement office’s custody into detention centers as opposed to group homes, according to an analysis of government data from October 2018 to May 2019 submitted during trial. In Miami it was 96 percent and in El Paso 80 percent. Lawyers for young detainees said the government had proved it did not have to happen that way. An ICE agent from the San Antonio field office, where placement statistics are considerably better, testified during the trial that if the resettlement office had not matched a teenager with a sponsor, he would find a group home that would take the migrant in. ICE agents in San Antonio placed just 2.6 percent of young migrants into detention facilities as opposed to releasing them to group homes or sponsors between October 2018 and May 2019. “We don’t detain our age-outs,” the ICE officer, Jose Munguia, testified.April Grant, a spokeswoman for ICE, declined to comment on the details of the continuing litigation. Ms. Grant said that when deciding whether to detain migrants who were aging out, the agency considered whether they were flight risks or dangers to themselves or the community, as well as whether an alternative space was available. While such transfers occurred in previous administrations, the Trump administration is using a rigged system that ensures immigrants in certain parts of the country will be detained when they turn 18, according to Stephen Patton, one of the lead lawyers in the trial litigated by the National Immigrant Justice Center and Kirkland & Ellis in the District of Columbia. ICE’s computerized “risk classification assessment” system allows agents to enter a migrant’s information, then recommends detention or release. But according to court documents, the agency tweaked the tool in August 2017 to eliminate the option of release, leaving only the recommendations of “detain” or “supervisor to determine.” A worksheet requiring ICE agents to document their considerations for alternatives to detention did not include a space to detail the potential shelters available. Agents are left with two options: “detain” or “not detain.” “There was not a shred of evidence that releasing these kids caused any problems or finding sponsors for them was an undue burden,” Mr. Patton said. “They could comply if they wanted to, and if they do comply almost everyone gets released.” Another issue with resettling minors has been the Trump administration’s efforts to require sponsors to provide fingerprints to the government. That has discouraged immigrant relatives from coming forward to claim minors in custody, immigration advocates say. In the 2019 fiscal year, 2,055 migrants were transferred to ICE custody, nearly double the 1,091 in the 2017 fiscal year, according to the Health and Human Services Department. Mark Weber, a department spokesman, said more than 140 young migrants had been handed over to ICE in 2020, but that is a small percentage of the children who cross the border each year and most are eventually matched with sponsors. Mr. Weber said the department grappled with the most border crossings in more than a decade last year and was still able to place 72,593 children with sponsors. He said “a special effort” was made to release the children before they turn 18. Ms. Grant, the ICE spokeswoman, declined to say how many of the migrants who turned 18 and were transferred to ICE custody were placed into a group home by the deportation agency. The agency has also resisted calls for the widespread releases of migrants as the coronavirus approached, though nearly 700 have been released during the pandemic. Matthew T. Albence, the acting director of ICE, told the House Oversight Committee last week that such a move would be a “huge pull factor” and create a “rush at the borders,” according to a statement from the committee. The agency said in a statement that it was continuing to consider releasing immigrants to “alternatives to detention options.” Those who have aged into the ICE detention centers say the virus has only added to concerns that include threats from fellow detainees, poor treatment by the staff and a lack of medical resources. Sulma Hernandez Alfaro, who fled to the border to escape abusive relatives in Honduras, said she was confused when ICE agents showed up at the government shelter where she was staying in San Benito, Texas, in 2017. She had already been told by the staff that she would be released to a nearby group home, La Posada Providencia, when she turned 18. Her lawyers’ pleas to ICE to release her to the group home went unanswered, according to court filings. She said she was threatened by other detainees and treated poorly by the detention center’s staff. On one occasion, a guard yelled at her when she asked for a tampon. When she asked for a spare change of clothes, she was scolded. “She just yelled at me and said I should just wash it in the sink because that’s why I have hands,” Ms. Alfaro said. A court ordered Ms. Alfaro’s release in May 2018, six days before she was granted asylum.Those are the same protections Jose Hernandez Velasquez hoped to obtain when he crossed the border in 2017. Mr. Velasquez was erroneously moved from the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement as a 17-year-old after he was given a dental exam that mistakenly determined he was an adult, according to his lawyers, who later obtained a birth certificate proving he was a minor. By then he had already spent 10 months in a maximum-security detention center. Such dental assessments are supposed to be used to determine ages only in conjunction with other evidence. “They told me that I was over the age and I wasn’t a minor even though I pleaded with them that I was. They just took me away,” Mr. Velasquez said in a February telephone interview from the Adelanto detention center in California. He was placed back into a detention facility when he turned 18. In addition to facing threats from other detainees, he said he developed depression and hypertension while detained. A federal judge this month ordered Mr. Velasquez to be released after his lawyers said in court filings that he was “vulnerable to serious disease” and that there was danger of the coronavirus spreading “uncontrollably with devastating results” in the detention center. Mr. Velasquez is now quarantining himself as a precaution. But before he went to self-isolate in Los Angeles, he asked his lawyer to stop by the beach. He had not seen the ocean in nearly three years.Kitty Bennett contributed research."
Executive Order Halting New Green Cards Includes Exceptions,"WASHINGTON — President Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday temporarily blocking the issuance of green cards to those outside the United States, but the measure includes numerous exemptions, like those for overseas spouses and young children of American citizens. The order, which will be in place for at least 60 days, will affect thousands of parents, adult children and siblings of citizens seeking to immigrate to the United States. Under the measure, a diversity visa lottery that issues about 50,000 visas each year will be suspended, and green card holders in the United States will be prevented from reuniting with their spouses abroad. But it does not apply to immigrants already in the United States, nor to those seeking temporary visas, including students or guest workers like farmers. Other exceptions include health care professionals and their families as well as people in the EB-5 program, who invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in programs that create jobs. Also exempt from the order are members of the military and their children, as well as Iraqis and those from Afghanistan who obtain a visa by assisting military operations. The policy could, however, be expanded; Mr. Trump’s top cabinet officials will convene in at least 30 days to review any restrictions on “nonimmigrant visas,” including visas for seasonal workers. While the president often rails against illegal immigration and promotes the construction of a wall along the southwestern border, the order is focused on the family-based immigration he and his allies have frequently assailed as “chain-based migration.” “It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad,” Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. “We must first take care of the American worker.” But as the pandemic touches every corner of daily life, including the economy, few employers are reaching out for workers at home or abroad. And critics have emphasized research that shows immigrants have a positive effect on the economy. Immigrants and their potential employers are also already subject to a certification process to ensure that there are an insufficient number of American workers to fill any potential job. “He’s saying the system, the labor protections existing in the statute right now, are not good enough,” said Theresa Cardinal Brown, the director of immigration and cross border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The executive order “means families will be separated, employers who have spent a lot of money and a lot of time to say, ‘This is the person I need for my company,’ will not have that person, and I can imagine they will not take kindly to this,” Ms. Brown said. Mr. Trump said this week he would impose a more sweeping order, saying he intended to close the United States to people trying to immigrate to the country to live and work. But under intense pressure from business groups, he backed off barring guest workers for technology companies, farms as well as other employers. Still, some business groups said they were frustrated by the move. “Given the unprecedented economic turmoil caused by the Covid-19 health crisis, it is especially important now to welcome the world’s top innovators and job creators, not send them home,” said John Neuffer, the chief of the Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group. More than one million immigrants were granted green cards in the 2019 fiscal year, and about half of them — 458,556 — were overseas. Many of those visas went to the spouses and children of citizens. Mr. Trump’s initial announcement, issued on Twitter late Monday night, that he intended to “suspend immigration” surprised many of his top officials in the Homeland Security and Defense Departments. The administration had already used authorities granted to Mr. Trump’s top health officials to effectively seal the southern border, and halt refugee flights and naturalization ceremonies. The State Department had suspended visa services last month at U.S. embassies and consulates, but immigrants were still able to take procedural steps to come to the United States. Hours before Mr. Trump signed the order, Kellyanne Conway, his top adviser, said lawyers were still completing the policy. The executive order seemed to acknowledge there might be issues with the ban’s enactment, noting that if any provisions were “held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements,” the relevant agency should subsequently fulfill those requirements. Mr. Trump has said that he may extend the policy after 60 days “based on economic conditions at the time.” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, the president and chief of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said that “economically speaking, the thinking behind this order plays into the patently flawed idea that American prosperity is a zero-sum game.” “To the contrary, we see consistently that immigrants are essential, entrepreneurial, taxpaying, and job-creating members of society,” she said."
Trump’s Scientists Push Back on His Claim That Virus May Not Return This Fall,"WASHINGTON — In February, President Trump told the public that the coronavirus should “go away” by April. In March, he said that the virus may “wash” away by summer. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump told the American public that the virus “won’t be coming back in the form that it was” this fall or winter. He then mused that it might not come back at all. The scientists flanking him at a White House briefing explicitly said otherwise.“There will be coronavirus in the fall,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, said as Mr. Trump looked on. More than 40,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, and the outbreak is still well underway. But in his public remarks, Mr. Trump has continued to broadcast his personal hopes for the virus, questioning its ability to last into the fall and winter. “If we have embers of corona coupled with the flu,” Mr. Trump said, “it’s not going to be what we’ve gone through in any way, shape or form,” after saying, “It’s also possible it doesn’t come back at all.” The president’s latest assertion seemed prompted by his anger with The Washington Post over an interview with Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published a day earlier. In that interview, Dr. Redfield warned that fall and winter would be taxing on Americans because influenza and the coronavirus would be circulating at the same time. “He was misquoted,” Mr. Trump said.“His whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot so that next fall we don’t have such a big season of flu,” the president continued. But when pressed by reporters, Dr. Redfield said he had been accurately quoted. “There’s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,” he said in that interview. On Wednesday, directed by the president to take the stage, Dr. Redfield said, “When I commented yesterday that there was a possibility of next fall and winter, it could be more difficult, more complicated when we had two respiratory illnesses circulating at the same time.” He added: “I didn’t say that this was going to be worse. I said that this was going to be more difficult.” Taking the lectern to quibble with reporters over the article — which had the headline “C.D.C. Director Warns Second Wave of Coronavirus Is Likely to Be Even More Devastating” — Mr. Trump said that Dr. Redfield did not actually know if “the corona” would come back, and that he had spoken to the doctor at “great length” about his comments. Asked how he could repeatedly assert that the coronavirus would come back in pockets or not at all by the winter, Mr. Trump said multiple times that there was reason to believe it might not. Health experts — including Dr. Redfield — have stressed that Americans need to be prepared either way. “If it does come back, it’s not going to come back, and I’ve spoken to 10 different people, it’s not going to be like it was,” the president said, citing improved containment and mitigation efforts. When pressed by reporters, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, did not directly support the president’s assertion. But Dr. Fauci, another leading scientific voice for the administration, supported Dr. Redfield’s assertion that the virus would be here in the fall. “What Dr. Redfield was saying, first of all, is that we will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that,” he said, adding: “It’s going to be complicated. So whether or not it’s going to be big or small is going to depend on our response.” The president has on multiple occasions suggested that the pandemic would ease off in the summer, despite research showing otherwise. Several small studies have indicated that while warmer temperatures might make it harder for the coronavirus to survive in the air or on surfaces for long periods of time, it could still be contagious for hours, if not days. Cases have also continued to explode in countries with equatorial climates and those in the Southern Hemisphere, which is currently in the middle of autumn.Knvul Sheikh contributed reporting."
Health Dept. Official Says Doubts on Hydroxychloroquine Led to His Ouster,"WASHINGTON — The official who led the federal agency involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine said on Wednesday that he was removed from his post after he pressed for rigorous vetting of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug embraced by President Trump as a coronavirus treatment, and that the administration had put “politics and cronyism ahead of science.” Rick Bright was abruptly dismissed this week as the director of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and removed as the deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response. He was given a narrower job at the National Institutes of Health. In a scorching statement, Dr. Bright, who received a Ph.D. in immunology and molecular pathogenesis from Emory University, assailed the leadership at the health department, saying he was pressured to direct money toward hydroxychloroquine, one of several “potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections” and repeatedly described by the president as a potential “game changer” in the fight against the virus. “I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,” he said in his statement. “I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science — not politics or cronyism — has to lead the way.” Doubts about the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus and the lack of evidence about the drug’s effectiveness — including some small studies that indicated patients could be harmed — appear to have dampened Mr. Trump’s enthusiasm for it. As the seriousness of the pandemic became clearer in mid-March, the president seized on anecdotal reports about victims of the coronavirus who recovered quickly after using the drug. Desperate for good news as he watched the death toll climb and the stock market plummet, Mr. Trump could hardly contain his excitement. In a post on Twitter on March 21, the president urged federal officials to quickly approve the use of hydroxychloroquine with an antibiotic called azithromycin — a combination that he believed could work on the coronavirus. “Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents) be put in use IMMEDIATELY,” he tweeted. “PEOPLE ARE DYING, MOVE FAST, and GOD BLESS EVERYONE!” By then, Mr. Trump’s favorite Fox News hosts were echoing his optimism that hydroxychloroquine could be a magic bullet against the virus. A day after meeting in the Oval Office with one of the hosts, Laura Ingraham, and two doctors promoting the drug as a cure-all, Mr. Trump became First Salesman, promoting it from the White House briefing room. “I’ll say it again: What do you have to lose?” Mr. Trump said on April 4, carefully pronouncing hydroxychloroquine. His presidential prescription: “Take it.” In briefing after briefing with reporters at the White House, Mr. Trump defied the voices of medical experts and some of his own top advisers — including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease specialist and an adviser to the coronavirus task force. They cautioned that hydroxychloroquine, which is used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus as well as malaria, needed to undergo the same kind of rigorous evaluation that other drugs do. At the end of March, a division of Novartis, a leading pharmaceutical company, donated 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to the health department’s stockpile for the possible use of treating Covid-19. Mr. Trump heralded the announcement a few days later, saying that the drug “may work, then again, it may not work.” But in mid-April, a small drug trial in Brazil was halted after some patients developed irregular heart rates. Then a study this week of 368 V.A. patients, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that it did not help patients avoid the need for ventilators, and that the use of the drug alone was associated with an increased risk of death. And , a panel of the government’s own experts at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said there was “insufficient data” to recommend taking it to treat symptoms from the virus. The president has not talked much since then about hydroxychloroquine.In his statement, Dr. Bright did not directly name Mr. Trump. But the searing language he used left little doubt that he viewed the administration’s support for the drug as pressure to ignore scientific facts in favor of politics. “My professional background has prepared me for a moment like this — to confront and defeat a deadly virus that threatens Americans and people around the globe,” Dr. Bright wrote. “To this point, I have led the government’s efforts to invest in the best science available to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.” “Unfortunately, this resulted in clashes with H.H.S. political leadership, including criticism for my proactive efforts to invest early into vaccines and supplies critical to saving American lives. I also resisted efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections,” he said, adding that hydroxychloroquine was “promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit.” But Trump administration officials painted a different picture of Dr. Bright’s tenure.Dr. Bright and Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response, clashed repeatedly, according to those officials. While Dr. Bright followed careful procedures, they said, he was a polarizing figure within the Department of Health and Human Services, where concerns had circulated about a management style that was described as confrontational. Those officials said that there had been discussions about removing Dr. Bright for many months, and that they came to a head after emails were leaked to Reuters last week detailing internal discussions about chloroquines. A senior administration official said that Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, told the coronavirus task force members in their meeting on Wednesday about Dr. Bright’s departure from BARDA, describing it as a promotion to the vice president. Officials left the meeting and learned of Dr. Bright’s public statement. In a statement, Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that “Dr. Bright has departed BARDA to N.I.H., where he’ll work on development and deployment of novel point-of-care testing platforms.” She added: “As it relates to chloroquine, it was Dr. Bright who requested an Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for donations of chloroquine that Bayer and Sandoz recently made to the Strategic National Stockpile for use on Covid-19 patients. The E.U.A. is what made the donated product available for use in combating Covid-19.” Asked about Dr. Bright and his transfer on Wednesday at the daily White House briefing, Mr. Trump said he did not know who he was. “I never heard of him,” the president told reporters. “You just mentioned the name, I never heard of him. When did this happen? I never heard of him. The guy says he was pushed out of a job. Maybe he was. Maybe he wasn’t; I’d have to hear the other side. I don’t know who he is.” A career government official who has led BARDA since 2016, Dr. Bright pointed specifically to the initial efforts to make chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine widely available before it was scientifically tested for efficacy with the coronavirus. “While I am prepared to look at all options and to think ‘outside the box’ for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public,” Dr. Bright said. He went on to describe what he said ultimately happened: “I insisted that these drugs be provided only to hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 while under the supervision of a physician.” A person familiar with Dr. Bright’s account said that Dr. Bright was pressured to rush access to the drug after the president and Larry Ellison, the chairman and chief technology officer of Oracle, had a conversation about chloroquines. Dr. Bright was then directed to put in place a nationwide expanded access program to make the drugs available on a broad basis without specific controls in place, according to the person familiar with his account. Medical experts say that it is still not known whether hydroxychloroquine might emerge as an effective treatment for the most devastating symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The studies in Brazil and at the Department of Veterans Affairs were small and limited. Comprehensive, peer-reviewed studies have yet to be completed, and while hospitals are using the drug, many doctors acknowledge they are doing so only because they have few other tools to help dying patients. And inside the White House, the drug still has its true believers, including Peter Navarro, a trade adviser who has been put in charge of procuring protective gear and other medical supplies to fight the virus. Mr. Navarro is relentless with anyone in the West Wing who will listen, encouraging the government to keep stockpiling the drug and dismissing the recent studies as “deeply flawed.” The Brazil study gave doses of hydroxychloroquine in excess of the levels recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, Mr. Navarro said in an interview. The veterans study administered the medicine too late and focused narrowly on an older population with high incidences of cardiac failure, diabetes and lung disease, among other issues, he insisted. “None of this was reported by a mainstream media which appears incapable of reading anything more than study headlines,” he said. “To date, almost 40 studies have reported apparent usefulness of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in shortening length of hospital stay, improving symptoms, and resolving lung lesions as seen on X-rays.” And some doctors around the country are still hopeful that more complete tests of the drug might still yield some positive news. Dr. William W. O’Neill, a cardiologist at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit who is organizing a large randomized study using the drug as a preventive medication in health care workers and emergency medical workers, said he had “cautious optimism” but urged the public to avoid drawing premature conclusions. “Everybody is desperate to find out all the answers,” Dr. O’Neill said. “But we have to be careful about jumping to conclusions either way.” Dr. Bright said his superiors at the Department of Health and Human Services were doing exactly that. Dr. Bright is represented by two lawyers who work with whistle-blowers, and who represented Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, accusing him of sexual misconduct decades ago, a claim he denied. In a statement, they called Dr. Bright’s change in position “retaliation, plain and simple” and said they planned to ask for an investigation.Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Katie Thomas contributed reporting from Chicago, and Kenneth P. Vogel and Ana Swanson from Washington."
The Cold Calculations Governors Will Have to Make Before Reopening,"WASHINGTON — How many deaths are acceptable to reopen the country before the coronavirus is completely eradicated? “One is too many,” President Trump insists, a politically safe formulation that any leader would instinctively articulate. But that is not the reality of Mr. Trump’s reopen-soon approach. Nor for that matter will it be the bottom line for even those governors who want to go slower. Until there is a vaccine or a cure for the coronavirus, the macabre truth is that any plan to begin restoring public life invariably means trading away some lives. The question is how far will leaders go to keep it to a minimum. Some of the more provocative voices on the political right say that with tens of millions of Americans out of work and businesses collapsing, some people must be sacrificed for the greater good of restoring the economy quickly. To many, that sounds unthinkable, but less inflammatory experts and policymakers also acknowledge that there are enormous costs to keeping so much of the work force idle, with many of the unemployed struggling to pay for food, shelter or medical care for other health challenges. And so the nation’s leaders are left with the excruciating dilemma of figuring out how to balance life and livelihood on a scale unseen in generations. “Every governor in the nation is asking that,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, where 2,700 have died and more than 1 million have lost jobs, said this week. “There’s no such thing as zero risk in the world in which we’re living. But we know that not taking measures to control the spread means that’s going to translate into lives lost.” With no cure available for the coronavirus and no vaccine likely for another year or more, governors in hard-hit states are seeking ways to minimize the number of additional deaths by staging and structuring any reopening. Time and testing are key, according to public health experts. The longer a quarantine can be extended the better, they say, and the more testing made available, the easier it would be to properly calibrate a reopening and respond to any new outbreak. Pushing to restore business sooner rather than later, Mr. Trump has dismissed waiting until comprehensive testing provides a better map of where the infection has spread. Instead, the federal government’s guidelines envision “sentinel surveillance” testing of vulnerable places like nursing homes and inner-city health centers, while gradually reopening businesses, schools and other venues in stages with precautions like masks, gloves and social distancing. All of which could mitigate future infections but would not halt them. The reason the death toll projection may be closer to 60,000 rather than the 2 million of one estimate was because society largely shut down. One recent study said that the 60,000 deaths would have been 6,000 had quarantine measures been imposed just two weeks earlier. So easing measures means the death toll will go up even with safeguards. But remaining closed is not without a cost either. In just four weeks, a staggering 22 million Americans have lost their jobs, the equivalent of the entire labor force of 23 states. The question divides not only the nation but even families. Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago and White House chief of staff, and his brother, Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a prominent medical ethicist and vice provost of global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania, have engaged in a running quarrel about how soon society should reopen. Rahm Emanuel considers it untenable to keep most of the country closed until the virus is completely under control, while Ezekiel Emanuel maintains that the pandemic is too much of a threat to rush back to life as usual. “There’s nothing you can do risk free. Nothing,” Rahm Emanuel said last week. “And the missing ingredient is what do you think the public can accept and what will you do to be forthright and honest?” The public, he said, understands that life comes with peril as long as measures are taken to minimize it. “If you reduce the speed limit dramatically, you’d have less deaths,” Mr. Emanuel said. “But we allow it to go to a certain level.” In a separate call, Ezekiel Emanuel said: “I think Rahm is wrong on how bad it could be by letting it run around the population. I’m not for keeping the economy closed forever. Sometimes my brother paints me in a picture. But you have to do it safely. Safely doesn’t mean no deaths. I never said no Covid deaths. But you have to do it in a way that is measured, not irresponsible where you’re going to get to 2 million deaths.” The trade-offs have stirred angry exchanges since the start of the lockdowns. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick of Texas, who is 70, said last month that older people like himself should be ready to risk death to save the economy for their grandchildren, comments he defended on Fox News on Monday night. In a separate appearance on Fox last week, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the television host, cited a study to argue that reopening schools “may only cost us 2 to 3 percent in terms of total mortality,” calling it “a trade-off some folks would consider.” After a backlash, he said he “misspoke” and expressed regret that he “confused and upset people.” Some of those charged with making these decisions said far more information is required to reopen with enough confidence to constrain further spread of the virus and avoid a deadly second wave. Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said his state would need to double the number of tests. “You have to crack the back of the personal health piece before you can crack the back of the economic piece,” he said this week. Noting that 177 people in his state died the day before, he added: “The house is still on fire and the fire brigade is still out there trying to put the fire out.” The situation, not surprisingly, looks different in different parts of the country. The trade-offs in Wyoming, where there have been six deaths, or in Hawaii, with 12 deaths, hardly compare to those in New Jersey, where more than 5,000 have died, or in New York, where more than 15,000 have died. The United States has always tolerated a certain amount of preventable death. To use Rahm Emanuel’s example, Americans reduce traffic fatalities by requiring seatbelts and airbags, imposing speed limits and employing police. But until better technology is perfected, the only way to actually stop all car crashes — banning cars — is untenable, so some deaths are countenanced, a total of 38,800 in 2019. Auto accidents are not communicable so not an apples-to-apples comparison to the coronavirus. But the ordinary flu still claims thousands of lives a year — anywhere from 12,000 in the 2011-12 season up to an estimated 61,000 in 2017-18 — which society accepts without stay-at-home orders. Those seasonal deaths, however, are spread over many months, while the coronavirus hit with catastrophic fury in a matter of weeks and would have caused even more devastation without the quarantines. Government makes money-versus-lives trade-offs all the time. When a regulatory agency weighs a new safety rule, it measures the cost to industry or consumers against the gain by assigning a dollar value to each life that might be saved. If a new rule costs billions of dollars but would only prevent a few dozen deaths, it likely would not be adopted — even though someone would die as a result. The idea that the government translates life to dollars and cents may sound bloodless but it is not unusual. A White House report from 2017, for instance, estimated the cost of 41,000 deaths attributed to opioid overdoses in 2015 at $431.7 billion, an average of $10.5 million per person. By that calculation, the 60,000 deaths projected from the coronavirus would be valued at $631.8 billion — while the roughly 2 million lives theoretically saved by lockdowns would be worth about $21 trillion, or nearly eight times the $2.7 trillion in relief spending brokered by Congress and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. But James H. Stock, a Harvard economist who served on President Barack Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, said this crisis goes beyond such ordinary calculations because a shuttered economy represents an almost existential threat to the very idea of America. “We really have to be talking not just about our reduction in consumption in the short run but what this is going to be doing to the economy and the republic in the long run,” he said. “It’s those big issues that we’ve been afraid to talk about. A year of this and we would just see an unrecognizable transformation of what America would look like coming out of it.” Stephen Moore, a conservative economist who serves on Mr. Trump’s reopening committee, said those advocating restarting the economy are caricatured as putting profits over lives. “I reject this idea that the people who are for keeping the economy shut down are the angels because they’re the ones who care about human life,” said Mr. Moore, who has coordinated with lockdown protesters. “What about the poverty? What about the suicides? What about the child abuse cases and the alcoholism and the drug overdoses and the depression and all of the negative effects to health and well-being that are associated with an economy in recession?” Studies show that depression, drug use and suicides spike during economic hardship, including after the last recession, and the all-consuming focus of the medical system on the coronavirus in certain areas has delayed other medical care. Yet that might be offset by falling violent crime, car crashes, workplace accidents and air pollution. Vehicle collisions in California decreased by half after its stay-at-home order went into effect while murder and air pollution are each down 25 percent in New York City. Some scholars argue that reopening too quickly would actually hurt the economy, particularly if it resulted in a second wave that destroyed public confidence. A study of the 1918 influenza pandemic found that cities that closed schools and banned public gatherings earlier and kept them shut longer not only had fewer deaths but emerged better economically. Governor Murphy said resuming public life would not succeed if people did not feel certain that the virus had been contained. Indeed, 76 percent of Americans said social distancing should continue as long as needed to curb the virus even if it meant continued damage to the economy, according to a new poll by Politico and Morning Consult, while just 14 percent favored an end to restrictions to stimulate the economy even if it meant spreading the virus. “If you opened every restaurant in New Jersey tomorrow, I don’t think anybody would show up,” Governor Murphy said. “It’s not like we’re holding back some pent-up demand. I don’t blame them — there are folks out there who are frustrated, who have cabin fever, who want to break free. So do I, by the way. But I think folks also want to have confidence that they’re not going to get sick and die.”"
Tight-Knit Company Towns Reel as Coronavirus Rolls Through,"As soon as she heard about a cluster of coronavirus cases at the Tyson pork processing plant on the edge of Columbus Junction, Iowa, Cindy Johnston felt a ripple effect through her small community along the Iowa River. Ms. Johnston, who manages a Dairy Sweet burgers and ice cream shack, sent home four teenage employees because their parents work at the Tyson plant. Parents of other teenage workers were too afraid of potential infection to let their children report to work at Dairy Sweet. Then, she learned of the death of an employee at the Tyson plant; it was the father of a classmate of her son. “I’ve lived in this community all my life, and I’ve never seen it so scared,” said Ms. Johnston, who is 52, nearly the same age as the father who died. Across the country, some big cities on the coasts are starting to experience a leveling off of Covid-19 cases, but a staggering number of small Midwestern towns anchored by meatpacking plants and other factories are finding themselves as new hot spots of the virus. The new cases are worrying because they come as many officials are contemplating reopening the nation’s businesses. The outbreaks now are raising the prospect of new spread in less populous communities in the middle of the country and complicating these company towns’ debates over when to restart public life. Tyson Foods closed the plant in Columbus Junction earlier this month. The company announced Wednesday it was closing a plant in Logansport, Ind., as well as a large pork processing plant in Waterloo, Iowa, after calls from public officials to shutter the facility amid a growing outbreak.A Smithfield meatpacking plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., has nearly 1,000 cases tied to its facility. And a JBS pork plant in Worthington, Minn., a Hormel food processing facility in Rochelle, Ill., and a ConAgra food processing plant in Marshall, Mo., are among others that have reported significant outbreaks. Infections can spread fast in the facilities as employees work side by side and gather in cafeterias or locker rooms. In many rural Midwestern areas, these businesses are often the only large workplaces for miles around. The new outbreaks have an outsize impact on families, congregations and, in particular, other businesses in communities that are trying to think about reopening as some political leaders in state capitals and in Washington call for the beginnings of a return to economic normalcy. “It’s going to be a new normal for us,” said Michael Schepp, owner of Helix Wine and Bites, a restaurant in Grand Forks, N.D., where public health officials have traced at least 128 positive cases of the virus to a wind power plant. Earlier this week, the plant, called LM Wind Power, which is owned by G.E., closed for what it said would be at least two weeks so it could be disinfected. Along with a university and a hospital system, the plant is one of the biggest employers in Grand Forks. The outbreak was another blow for business owners like Mr. Schepp, who had been scrambling to figure out how the restaurant could reopen its dining room. “As a city we were in really good shape leading up to that, but it shows you how quickly this thing can change,” he said. Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, a Republican, has called for a reopening of the economy on May 1. Mr. Schepp hopes that by then he can allow a limited number of patrons in his dining room. But he said he is not sure exactly how that would work. In the meantime, he has been serving wine by the glass and cocktails to-go. “We’re going to have to reinvent the restaurant industry,” he said.In Madison, Neb., residents are bracing for a broader spread of the virus after six cases were reported at a Tyson plant on Sunday. The plant is the biggest workplace around, with Madison residents and commuters among its employees. Some local businesses such as Burrito King, a beloved restaurant, have closed completely. In the community of about 2,400 residents, volunteers have donated floral bouquets and cupcakes to nursing home residents who no longer can receive visitors because of the virus threat, and the fire department has offered to drive by, sirens blaring, the homes of children celebrating birthdays. Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, who has declined to issue a blanket stay-at-home order, has called for a gradual reopening of the economy starting next month. But Madison is planning to take things extra slowly, Al Brandl, the mayor, said. “We want to just get through this,” he said.In Columbus Junction, practically everyone in the community of 2,000 residents works at the Tyson plant or knows someone who does. And now, after the outbreak at the plant earlier this month, nearly everyone knows someone who has the virus. Almost 150 workers among the plant’s 1,400 employees have tested positive for the virus. Two employees have died. The plant looms large over the town, its tentacles reaching a church where sickened employees are among congregants and now in need of prayers and grocery deliveries, and a day care facility that already had seen its numbers shrink and decided to send home children whose parents worked at the plant. It affected the clients of the veterinary practice of Mike Todd who passes by the Tyson plant on his way to farms to treat large animals, a part of his business he still operates because he can maintain social distancing easily in a barn or pasture.  Mr. Todd is slowly trying to reopen his Louisa Veterinary Clinic. He’s vaccinating puppies to prevent illness. And on Tuesday, he removed a tumor from a dog. He plans to allow for more elective procedures in the days to come. “We’re just being careful,” he said. “Everything is a risk to some extent.” On Main Street in Columbus Junction, Five Star Grocery is still open, but Joseph Hu, the owner, is allowing just two people inside at a time. His small store caters to fellow Burmese immigrants who moved to the town to work at the pork plant. “Now that the virus is here, nobody is shopping,” Mr. Hu said. “A lot of people are scared.”Across the country, everyone is looking ahead to reopening the economy. Mr. Hu is no different, even though the possibility seems tenuous in the small community that is in the midst of managing such a large outbreak. The Tyson plant had shut down on April 6, and Mr. Hu said that his optimism was bolstered after he learned that the plant partially reopened this week. Company officials said that the facility had been disinfected and that they were checking employees’ temperatures, installing workstation dividers and requiring face coverings for workers. Sick employees will be better soon, Mr. Hu predicted, and then they will start shopping again.The owners of Dairy Sweet, a part-year operation that is about two miles from the Tyson plant, opened two weeks ahead of its usual seasonal schedule after realizing business at their other restaurant, the 92 Roadhouse Bar and Grill, was too scarce to keep it open for carryout, said Ms. Johnston, the Dairy Sweet manager. Ms. Johnston said she sensed that the community was starting to feel a bit more at ease in recent days. Ms. Johnston has “adopted” a high school senior, a volunteer project to send small gifts to students whose final high school year has been cut short. She offered on Facebook to buy groceries for anyone in need. So far, she has had no takers. Ms. Johnston is trying to stay healthy. She is downing extra vitamin C and elderberry supplements. Her hands are chapped from washing them so much. At Dairy Sweet, employees are wearing masks and gloves. They rub credit cards with Clorox wipes before and after handling them. Other than that, the business hasn’t changed much since it first opened in 1956. It never had a dining room; customers place orders at a pickup window or a drive-through. In that way, Dairy Sweet is one of the few places in town that feels normal. Most days, in fact, business is way up, double its usual, she said.Mitch Smith and Jack Healy contributed reporting."
Q&A With a Trump Economic Adviser,"Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.Conservative economist Stephen Moore has been busy these days. A member of the president’s economic task force, he’s been pushing the administration and governors to loosen the stay-at-home orders as soon as possible. He’s been working closely with groups like FreedomWorks to nurture and promote some of the protests across the country. And he’s been on a bit of a media tour, warning Americans that the country stands on the verge of “economic carnage” if it doesn’t reopen soon. A conservative commentator and Trump campaign economic adviser, Mr. Moore has long courted controversy. His nomination to a seat on the Federal Reserve board last year was pulled by the administration after Republican lawmakers criticized his past comments about women, economists questioned his track record and some conservatives said he lacked the “intellectual gravitas” for the post. There’s no question about his partisan credentials. Mr. Moore was one of the founders of the Club for Growth, which advocates limited government and low taxes. In 2012, Mr. Moore helped design tax cuts in Kansas that exploded the state’s budget without producing a promised economic boom. Mr. Moore offered his broad thoughts on the economic impacts of the coronavirus, noting that he’s not a public health expert — nor has he completed any studies of the effects as of yet. We spoke to him about the risks of reopening, what he’s advising the president and his predictions of a coming “economic civil war.” (As always, our conversation has been edited and condensed.) Hi, thanks for speaking with me. So starting this week, some states are reopening; some states aren’t. These places that are reopening — like Georgia, Tennessee — are they right to do so? We really are seeing the economic carnage cascade in a big way. And as an economist — I’m not a health expert, I don’t pretend to be, I’m an economist — we’re doing some studies on this now that there is a big, big difference in terms what the economy is going to look like six months and nine months and a year from now based on opening the economy, say, May 1st versus June 1st or June 15th. You sit on the president’s economic council, is that what you are advising him right now?For the good of the country, we have to really get things opened. I said, “Mr. President, if you can get the economy open by May 1 and right from that date” — and by the way, that, of course, means that some states will open and others won’t — “that you could possibly see this recovery by the end of the summer, and we can really get through this.” Why do you think we’re late in reopening?Everybody can look at the map. And there’s a severe breakout in about 15 major metropolitan areas. And any pandemic is an urban experience, right? So the idea of having a policy in Lincoln, Nebraska, or Des Moines, Iowa, or Boise, Idaho, that’s the same as New York City is ridiculous. What we should have done all along is really done this in a more surgical way rather than having a widespread shutdown. I just completely reject this instant response — what I’m saying is, “Oh, this is putting profits and greed over saving lives,” and so on. That’s a false choice. After all, the people who are being hurt the most here are really the least among us, the poorest people, the middle-class people who really live paycheck to paycheck. And they are the ones who are experiencing the real deprivation and the ruination of their lives. The misery and toil that we’re putting on people at the bottom is extraordinary here. What public health officials would say is that part of the reason those places haven’t seen the same level of illness is because they did shut down. And if you reopen the virus will spread. Well, it’s a fair point. I can’t argue against that.I’m not a public health official. Maybe I’ve got this wrong, but it’s because people get these diseases in congested areas. So in the middle of Little Washington, Va., you’re not having people crowded together. So you don’t need the same kind of measures in a little town like that as you do in New York City or Chicago or Detroit. Do you think the public health officials are taking the economic issues seriously enough?I can’t talk for everyone in the public health community but when people like Fauci — I know one thing that just set people off was when Fauci said, “We’re sorry for the inconvenience.” Look, this is no inconvenience. This is a trauma that we’ve never seen our country in 75 years. And this is life altering for people, and many people will never get their lives back to what it was before. So that’s insulting, frankly, to say that to the people who are — 20 or 23 million people, it’s probably going to be closer to 30 million by the end of this week, in unemployment lines. You have to calibrate that versus what are we doing to public health and our society, our societal well-being by impoverishing our people. And that’s what we’re doing. There’s also a racial component, right, which is that the people more likely to get sick and die from the virus are more likely to be African-American. We’ve seen that data too. So how do you weigh the racial inequalities of this virus? The people who are suffering the most are minorities. There’s no question about that. By the way, that’s in no small part because minorities tend to be living in major cities where they’re living close together. But they also are the people — I mean, look at the people in the soup lines and the people waiting for The Salvation Army trucks. I mean, they are minorities as well. They are the ones whose lives have been really shattered. We can use really good public safety measures, social distancing the work force, disinfectants everywhere, masks. I was thinking this morning, and this is just kind of a thought experiment because I was thinking about this — why don’t we just put everybody in a space outfit or something like that? No. Seriously, I mean — Well, we’d have to make the space outfits, right?I know we don’t have space outfits [laughter]— I mean, just thinking out loud, and maybe this is a crazy idea, but instead of just locking down the economy, putting everybody in a kind of — you’re right. You have to make 200 million of these, but it wouldn’t have cost $3 trillion to do that. And you can have for months people just walking around in these kind of — I mean, I was looking online, and there are all these kinds of suits that they’re building now that you’re not exposed and you’re breath — kind of ventilator. Speaking of lacking mass production, do you think the testing is there to reopen? There’s an argument that you can’t go back to work without more testing. I have a strong feeling about that, which is I think that the people who are in favor of keeping the economy shut down, that testing has become an excuse to keep the economy locked down for more weeks. That’s become the mantra, right? We have to have testing. Nobody argues that testing isn’t a good thing. But can we afford to wait three weeks or whatever it’s going to take so we have all the testing? No. We’ve got to start now. Look, the summer is going to be a catastrophe. It’s going to be really, really bad. We’re going to have long, long unemployment lines, and we’re going to see 15, 20 percent unemployment, just horrific. They talk about bending the curve of the disease, but we also have to bend the curve of unemployment, poverty. Americans, I think, are just under this delusion that what’s going to happen is a month from now, it will all be — we’ll have hopefully conquered this disease, and we can all go outside again. It will be sort of back to what it was. No. It’s going to be like a nuclear bomb was dropped on the economy. People aren’t just going to go right back to their jobs and so on. It’s going to be really, really, really rough. We’re going to have effects that affect our society for a decade from this shutdown. Why do you think the blue states have been more cautious about reopening?This country is so divided along ideological grounds today that it is — it’s frightening to me actually. What you’re going to see is a kind of economic civil war over the next 10 weeks between red states and blue states. Red states are opening; blue states aren’t. You’re going to have commerce going on in Nashville, Tennessee, but not in Detroit, not in Chicago, and not in New York City. It sounds like the world you envision to start as soon as possible is one where we’re all wearing masks; some businesses are open; some businesses aren’t open; and it’s county by county. Or do you think everything should just sort of open up, and we go back with masks and social distance the best we can, or? I’m just saying let’s be really smart about it. And maybe by a county-by-county basis. Definitely using disinfectants, using screening, using — when you go to the White House, you have to take your temperature. I don’t have a problem with if you go into a restaurant, you have to take your temperature, or if you go into any kind of public place — and opening businesses that don’t have people in close proximity or having tables apart from each other and that kind of thing and just doing it on a rolling basis. Look, there’s going to be risks to this. The nightmare is if we start to reopen up things on a rolling basis, and then we have another outbreak. And that would be horrific. That would be horrific in every way, right? So I’m not insensitive to the risks here because we just don’t know what is going to happen with this virus. All I’m saying is that if we keep economy shut down for another month, we will have a kind of second Great Depression, and that involves untold human misery that we don’t even want to contemplate. But isn’t the concern of the second outbreak part of what necessitates the stay-at-home orders? Are you saying because we don’t know when, or if, a second outbreak could happen, the health risk is worth taking because the economic costs are potentially so severe? I don’t even like to put it in a trade-off. What I’m saying is we have no choice. If you don’t have an economy that’s functioning, you don’t have a society. I mean, we’re going to have people starving so we don’t have any choice here really. We have to get things up and running. We have to be really smart. We have to have a functioning economy. How are we going to do it in the smartest way possible with the best screening, best testing? So that’s my take. Are you wearing a mask when you go out?Yeah.Oh, you are?The reason I’m doing it is because I think it makes people feel uncomfortable if you don’t have a mask. So I’m not doing it for my own health. Look, I think we should all be sensitive to people. There’s no big deal about wearing a mask. I mean, do I like wearing it? No. I don’t. It gets kind of smelly, stuff like that. But people should be sensitive to other people’s concerns. But look, I have a problem now when I go out and play basketball with my kids and — with four, five kids playing basketball. And then the neighbors are calling the police on us. I mean, it’s like ridiculous. I mean, what is this? Russia? I have a big problem with that, with busybodies and bossy people. All right.

Coronavirus Diary: We’re sharing some of your dispatches from around the globe about life in the time of coronavirus.Today, we have Nancy Tolson, of Indianapolis.I am 84 with mild C.O.P.D. I live alone, and believe me, since late February, that is completely alone! I want to stay alive long enough to see my great-grandchildren again, and I have determined that it will take a year or more to do so. I will continue my social distancing until there is a vaccine. Fortunately, I drive, and can pick up grocery items outside the store. I get meds at the drive-through.I spend my days reading, talking by phone with family and with friends I haven’t been in touch with until recently, watching some TV (never the White House briefings!), and keeping in touch with various groups by email. I am finishing the wonderful book by John Meacham, “The Soul of America.”My biggest concern is that I am not able to visit my two CASA cases. I am a volunteer for Child Advocates, and our responsibility is to watch over children and youth in foster care, making sure that they are safe and secure. I would normally visit my homes at least once a month, but now cannot do so. I am speaking with them by phone, but this is not as satisfactory since it is important to get visuals about how they look, react, etc.As for my mental state, I am content most of the time.

DeVos Excludes ‘Dreamers’ From Coronavirus College Relief,"WASHINGTON — The Education Department will prohibit colleges from granting emergency assistance to undocumented students, even those known as Dreamers who are under federal protection, according to guidance issued to colleges and universities on Tuesday. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ordered higher education institutions to dole out more than $6 billion in emergency relief only to students who are eligible for federal financial aid, including U.S. citizens or legal residents. The directive effectively excluded tens of thousands of students who are living in the United States under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, an Obama-era policy that protects hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. President Trump has moved to end the program, but that effort is awaiting Supreme Court review.The measure will compound the challenges facing undocumented students, whose families have also been excluded from aid like stimulus checks for individuals and unemployment insurance, said Miriam Feldblum, the executive director of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, which advocates on behalf of immigrant students. In a recent report, the organization counted 450,000 undocumented students enrolled in the nation’s higher education system, with 87 percent of DACA-eligible students in undergraduate programs, and 13 percent in graduate-level programs. In a recent survey of more than 1,600 students, conducted by the organization TheDream.US, a national scholarship organization for Dreamers, 80 percent of those working have experienced income loss, said Candy Marshall, the group’s president. Sixty-five percent reported that they needed help with rent and utilities, and 48 percent said that of food. “This is not simply saying undocumented students shouldn’t get things that other students don’t get,” Ms. Feldblum said. “This was a choice. This was going to be a core lifeline.” The funding is part of $12.6 billion allocated directly to colleges and universities under Congress’s $2 trillion coronavirus stabilization law to help them recoup financial damages caused by the pandemic. Half of those funds are supposed to go directly to students affected by campus closures. In the coming weeks, schools are expected to award emergency relief grants to students to pay for expenses like food, housing, child care and technology. The stimulus law, called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, directs the secretary to distribute the stimulus funding to colleges in the same manner the department distributes other financial aid. ​But it ​did not explicitly define which students are eligible. Undocumented students do not qualify for federal financial aid funds, but ​the emergency grants do not fall under that category. In a statement, Angela L. Morabito, a department spokeswoman, defended its decision.“The CARES Act makes clear that this taxpayer-funded relief fund should be targeted to U.S. citizens, which is consistently echoed throughout the law,” she said. Higher education groups were not surprised that the Trump administration targeted unauthorized immigrants, but said Ms. DeVos’s messaging had been inconsistent. In a letter announcing the grants, Ms. DeVos said the law “provides institutions with significant discretion on how to award this emergency assistance to students,” and “the only statutory requirement is that the funds be used to cover expenses related to the disruption of campus operations due to coronavirus.” “This means that each institution may develop its own system and process for determining how to allocate these funds, which may include distributing the funds to all students or only to students who demonstrate significant need,” she wrote. The new guidance has caused “head-snapping uncertainty on college campuses,” said Terry Hartle, a senior vice president at the American Council on Education. “We fear that campuses will be in the position to only give money to people already getting financial aid, using a complicated, time-consuming process that is completely inconsistent with emergency grants,” Mr. Hartle said. He added that the decision was clearly made by the department. “Congress had nothing to do with it,” he said. “The department has to own it.” Justin Draeger, the president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, said the department’s method to exclude DACA and undocumented students by enforcing federal aid eligibility rules created obstacles for large swaths of other students, including international students and citizens who do not fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA. The department’s interpretation would require that schools verify eligibility requirements like whether students have minor drug convictions, have defaulted on student loans or, for men, have not registered with the Selective Service. Mr. Draeger said he feared schools would default to prioritizing students who had federal financial aid applications on file rather than those who needed the assistance most. “Schools are feeling frustrated that the department has overreached, and they’re cautious about moving forward at this point,” Mr. Draeger said. Wesley Whistle, a senior adviser for policy and strategy at the think tank New America, said the measure was consistent with the Trump administration’s track record, especially since relief was being directed to for-profit colleges, which the administration has treated favorably. “It’s crazy that they’re willing to give away money to for-profits, including those that have had settlements for predatory practices, but they want to make it harder for black and brown students to get it,” he said. “We’re in a pandemic, for Pete’s sake.”"
House Democrats Retreat on Remote Voting as Republicans Clamor to Reopen,"WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders backed away on Wednesday from a plan to change the rules of the House to allow lawmakers to cast votes remotely for the first time in history, after Republicans who are clamoring to reopen Congress registered their sharp opposition. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Democrats on a conference call that the House would no longer vote on Thursday as planned on a proposal to allow members to designate another lawmaker to cast votes for them by proxy, according to two officials familiar with the announcement. Instead, she said she and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader, would have a bipartisan group of lawmakers consider remote voting proposals and plans to reopen the House. The turnabout on Wednesday, a day after the vote was announced, underscores how bitterly partisan the debate over remote voting has become as Republican lawmakers increasingly push to have Congress return to its usual routine in Washington. The fight mirrors those raging across the nation as governors struggle to balance the economic pain and disruption of shuttering their states with public health guidelines to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, and as small but angry protests reflect a fierce strain of conservative disaffection with the restrictions. President Trump has stoked that anger, tweeting his support for protests of state-issued stay-at-home orders. In a letter on Tuesday, Mr. McCarthy called on Ms. Pelosi to work with him to create “a clear, safe and effective plan for reopening Congress,” and argued that lawmakers’ jobs were “essential work” that should continue during the pandemic. “I think we can agree that our institution’s current posture cannot and should not become the norm,” he wrote. Ms. Pelosi announced the decision to delay the move to remote voting after speaking with Mr. McCarthy for just over an hour, according to a leadership aide who said Ms. Pelosi had reversed course to ensure that such a monumental change to the rules would be bipartisan. Mr. McCarthy and Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, will sit on the bipartisan task force, along with the top lawmakers on the Rules and Administration Committees, to study voting options and a reopening plan. “The part I did not want to see is it change more than 200 years of history just by one party,” Mr. McCarthy said Wednesday at a news conference outside the Capitol. “We’ve been through war and others, and this body has still been able to meet. Whatever we do, when it comes to voting and others, should be bipartisan.” Mr. McCarthy raised concerns about allowing one lawmaker to vote on behalf of an absent colleague, saying it distorted congressional representation, and that voters “don’t lend their voice to another member of Congress.” “Would you want one member of Congress to have 30 votes or more,” he asked. “That’s why it needs to be thought out — what is the best way to deal with this?” The proposal put forward by Democrats would have required lawmakers to sign a letter to the House clerk designating a lawmaker to vote on their behalf and how they would vote, a designation that would be publicly available. Some Republicans have chafed in recent days at the notion that remote voting was needed at all, arguing that lawmakers should return to Washington to conduct business as usual. Several were agitating to stage a protest of sorts on the House floor this week, to demand answers from Democrats about when Congress would resume normal operations. “If we can have our ambulances, our health care workers and folks in grocery stores — and all of those brave Americans out there taking those risks — I’m ready to take those risks, too,” said Representative Michael Waltz, Republican of Florida. “I can’t overstate how desperate things are becoming. We have to get to work.” Republican leaders echoed the sentiment, implicitly criticizing Democrats in a sign that the debate over reopening Congress was likely to devolve into a highly politicized brawl in the weeks to come. “Every day the president goes to work in the White House,” said Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the minority whip, ticking off a list of administration officials who also show up. “Yet you see the House of Representatives — the people’s House — shut down.” Democratic leaders, after initially expressing reluctance to upend House rules to accommodate remote legislating, had framed the proxy voting arrangement as a common-sense solution that would allow lawmakers to do their jobs while following public health guidance. As the pandemic has taken hold, Congress has shifted into a nebulous state — not quite shuttered but not quite in regular session either — with both chambers taking extended recesses and returning only to pass legislation on a consensus basis, hoping that, given the extraordinary circumstances, nobody would object. That precarious arrangement is increasingly untenable as mounting partisan divisions over how to respond to the crisis make broad legislative agreements less and less likely. At the same time, many states have put in place strict social distancing restrictions, and public health experts are still advising people to avoid unnecessary travel and congregating in large groups, making the idea of a return to Washington by 429 House members problematic. “This virus has forced us to do things in different ways and become radically different in many respects for the safety and security of the health of all of our country,” Mr. Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday. “Therefore, we have to look at ways that perhaps we can still accomplish our business, but do it in a way that is safe and secure for our members.” But he also said any decision to adopt a remote voting policy should be bipartisan, and made in consultation with Republican leadership, a position he said he had shared with the Rules Committee. “We don’t want that to be perceived as trying to get some partisan gain by providing for that alternative,” Mr. Hoyer said, adding that he had been in touch with Mr. McCarthy. Efforts to adopt similar remote voting procedures in the Senate are unlikely to be successful. An attempt by Senator Rand Paul to change the rules to allow it was stymied on Tuesday by his fellow Kentucky Republican, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. The action came just after the Senate passed its latest coronavirus relief package — a $484 billion bill to replenish a depleted small-business loan program and provide funds for hospitals and testing — with only a half-dozen senators on hand for a voice vote, the only option since most senators were not in Washington. “I do think that the next time we pass a coronavirus rescue bill, we need to have everyone here and everyone engaged,” Mr. McConnell said afterward."
Al Gore Endorses Joe Biden for President: ‘This Is Not Complicated’,"Former Vice President Al Gore endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday, adding to the growing circle of prominent Democrats throwing their support behind him as the party works to coalesce before the general election. Mr. Gore announced his support in a tweet shortly before appearing, virtually, with Mr. Biden for a town hall-style Earth Day event. His endorsement followed one earlier in the day from Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who ran a climate-focused campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. “If I was talking to one person who had not yet decided who to vote for in this upcoming election, I would just say plainly and simply: This is not complicated,” Mr. Gore said at the Earth Day town hall. “If you care about the climate crisis, if you want to start solving the climate crisis, this is not rocket science.” “This is a real simple choice,” he added later, “and if anybody has any doubt about that, come talk to me.” Mr. Gore served as vice president under Bill Clinton and was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000. But two decades later, he is better known for his climate activism. As vice president, he helped craft the Kyoto Protocol, which President George W. Bush abandoned in 2001 — just as President Trump abandoned its successor, the Paris Agreement, in 2017. As a private citizen, he made the climate change documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.” Mr. Gore comes from a very different Democratic Party than the one that exists today, and served in an administration whose policies many Democrats, especially younger ones, now explicitly reject. But in an election in which voters have described climate change as one of the most important issues, his voice could be influential. During Wednesday’s event, he made an explicit pitch to young voters, who largely supported Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic primary. Youth-led climate groups like the Sunrise Movement endorsed Mr. Sanders, and they are among the constituencies Mr. Biden needs to win over for the general election. “I remember, as you do, when President John F. Kennedy put out his inspiring challenge to put a person on the moon and return him safely in 10 years,” Mr. Gore said, referring to an address Kennedy gave to Congress in May 1961, when Mr. Gore was 13 and Mr. Biden was 18. “And I remember the adults of that day and time, many of them saying that’s a reckless, expensive, unwise venture.” But when Apollo 11 landed on the moon eight years later, he continued, the average age of the system engineers in NASA’s mission control center was 26. “That means their average age when they heard that speech was 18, and they changed their lives and they got the knowledge and the learning to be a part of that mission,” Mr. Gore said. “That’s what I feel from the young people in this country today where the climate crisis is concerned.” It remains to be seen whether his endorsement will sway the young progressives who voted for Mr. Sanders. What it certainly does is reinforce the central image Mr. Biden’s campaign is trying to present: a Democratic Party that has moved on quickly from its hard-fought primary and united around its presumptive nominee in the face of a once-in-a-lifetime threat. Within weeks after he essentially wrapped up the nomination, Mr. Biden has received endorsements from former President Barack Obama, Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, another primary opponent. His campaign has unveiled several major endorsements in quick succession as something of a show of force."
U.S. May Share Less Intelligence With Countries That Criminalize Homosexuality,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering cutting back on sharing intelligence with partner countries that criminalize homosexuality as part of a push by the acting director of national intelligence, Richard Grenell, to prod those nations to change their laws. The intelligence community should be pushing American values with the countries it works with, Mr. Grenell said in an interview this week. “We can’t just simply make the moral argument and expect others to respond in kind because telling others that it’s the right thing to do doesn’t always work,” he said. But, he added, “to fight for decriminalization is to fight for basic human rights.” Mr. Grenell is thought to be the first openly gay cabinet member and has put anti-discrimination issues near the top of his agenda. In his earlier post as the American ambassador to Germany, Mr. Grenell began last year assembling gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender groups from the United States and other countries as part of the administration’s effort to change anti-gay laws. While tying human rights reforms to national security is often the hallmark of Democratic administrations, mixing hard-power priorities with trade and other issues has been part of President Trump’s foreign policy. Stuart Milk, head of the Harvey Milk Foundation and nephew of Harvey Milk, the first openly gay elected official in a major American city, said Mr. Grenell reached out to work with his organization on decriminalization. Mr. Milk said he was cleareyed about the Trump administration’s poor record on L.G.B.T. rights, particularly given its efforts to roll back anti-discrimination efforts for transgender troops in the military. “In some ways, Ric is driving this without a lot of deep support in the administration,” Mr. Milk said. “But I think he is very sincere. He is someone who believes, at the very minimum, decriminalization should happen. And if we have an administration where people wouldn’t suspect this drive to be coming from, it makes it a little bit more powerful.” Mr. Grenell said he had the backing of the White House. “We have the president’s total support,” he said. “This is an American value, and this is United States policy.” About 69 countries criminalize homosexuality, mostly in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. But the list of countries includes some critical American intelligence partners such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Kenya. Mr. Grenell would not say whether the administration was considering withholding additional cooperation, or ratcheting back current intelligence sharing with countries that criminalize homosexuality. His office is forming a group to review the issue and develop ideas, intelligence officials said. “If a country that we worked in as the United States intelligence community was arresting women because of their gender, we would absolutely do something about it,” Mr. Grenell said. “Ultimately, the United States is safer when our partners respect basic human rights.” Mr. Grenell has also suggested in meetings that foreign aid be used as an incentive to prod countries with bans on homosexuality to remove them, said Hadi Damien, the founder of Lebanon’s Beirut Pride group, who participated in the discussions Mr. Grenell held as ambassador to Germany. But Mr. Grenell has been careful to try to use aid as an incentive to alter laws, not a sanction against countries. “While the U.S., or any other country, cannot influence how other countries process their domestic affairs, the U.S. can push toward change through the voice of its officials and through the implementation of its programs,” Mr. Damien said. While Mr. Grenell is serving only in an acting capacity, and his appointment will likely end in September or when the Senate confirms a replacement, he has begun work on some controversial changes, including a review aimed at shrinking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and sending some officers detailed to that office back to their home intelligence agencies. He has also rebuffed calls by Democrats for him to hold off on those changes. “I am not a seat warmer,” Mr. Grenell said. “The president asked me to do a job and I am going to do the job to the best of my ability.” In a letter sent last week to the agencies he oversees, Mr. Grenell said the intelligence community needed to do better to detect, and respond to, discrimination and harassment of gay, lesbian and transgender people. “I expect every I.C. agency to ensure policies are specific and deliberate in protecting the L.G.B.T. work force,” Mr. Grenell wrote. In the interview, Mr. Grenell said his office was reviewing the security clearance process and the kinds of questions that contractors and F.B.I. agents were asking during background checks. He said he wanted to ensure the process did not lead to transgender people in transition being outed to former colleagues, or gay people who were not out to families being put in difficult positions. “You have to be sensitive to the individual’s personal situation, but the L.G.B.T. community also has to remember authenticity in the I.C. is fundamental to doing national security and intelligence jobs,” Mr. Grenell said. “You don’t ever want to be in a position of hiding anything. That is how you can be compromised or blackmailed. So it is really important to be authentic, but to be authentic, people need to feel comfortable and safe.” Until the 1980s, the government denied security clearances to gays, lesbians, bisexual and transgender people, under the belief that their sexual identity could be used to force them to give up secrets. While those questions have been removed from security clearance questionnaires, Mr. Milk said that discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people persists in the intelligence agencies. Mr. Milk held a session last year at the Pentagon, where he spoke with people working for the National Security Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency and other agencies. “We had a lot of people from the intelligence community at this listening event, people from the N.S.A. and other intelligence branches, who were talking about how difficult it was, still to this day, to be L.G.B.T. in those branches of government,” Mr. Milk said."
The Untold Story of the Birth of Social Distancing,"WASHINGTON — Fourteen years ago, two federal government doctors, Richard Hatchett and Carter Mecher, met with a colleague at a burger joint in suburban Washington for a final review of a proposal they knew would be treated like a piñata: telling Americans to stay home from work and school the next time the country was hit by a deadly pandemic. When they presented their plan not long after, it was met with skepticism and a degree of ridicule by senior officials, who like others in the United States had grown accustomed to relying on the pharmaceutical industry, with its ever-growing array of new treatments, to confront evolving health challenges. Drs. Hatchett and Mecher were proposing instead that Americans in some places might have to turn back to an approach, self-isolation, first widely employed in the Middle Ages. How that idea — born out of a request by President George W. Bush to ensure the nation was better prepared for the next contagious disease outbreak — became the heart of the national playbook for responding to a pandemic is one of the untold stories of the coronavirus crisis. It required the key proponents — Dr. Mecher, a Department of Veterans Affairs physician, and Dr. Hatchett, an oncologist turned White House adviser — to overcome intense initial opposition. It brought their work together with that of a Defense Department team assigned to a similar task.And it had some unexpected detours, including a deep dive into the history of the 1918 Spanish flu and an important discovery kicked off by a high school research project pursued by the daughter of a scientist at the Sandia National Laboratories. The concept of social distancing is now intimately familiar to almost everyone. But as it first made its way through the federal bureaucracy in 2006 and 2007, it was viewed as impractical, unnecessary and politically infeasible. “There were two words between ‘shut’ and ‘up’” initially, said Dr. Howard Markel, who directs the University of Michigan’s Center for the History of Medicine and who played a role in shaping the policy as a member of the Pentagon research team. “It was really ugly.” Dr. Mecher was there when Dr. Hatchett presented government public health experts the plan that the two of them and Dr. Lisa M. Koonin of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had reviewed over burgers and beer. “People could not believe that the strategy would be effective or even feasible,” Dr. Mecher recalled. But within the Bush administration, they were encouraged to keep at it and follow the science. And ultimately, their arguments proved persuasive. In February 2007, the C.D.C. made their approach — bureaucratically called Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions, or NPIs — official U.S. policy. Following a five-year review by the Obama administration, the strategy was updated in a document published in 2017. And after long delays in which President Trump played down the threat from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and failed to heed warnings about it from inside his own government, it was used to encourage the states to lock down as confirmed cases and deaths shot up. The Bush Initiative The effort began in the summer of 2005 when Mr. Bush, already concerned with bioterrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, read a forthcoming book, “The Great Influenza,” by John M. Barry, about the Spanish flu outbreak of 1918. Mr. Bush’s concern was elevated by a string of new outbreaks caused by infectious diseases transferring from birds and other animals to humans, including an avian flu outbreak that year in Vietnam. Because there was no vaccine for these new threats, they could spread rapidly. “A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire,” Mr. Bush said in a speech at the National Institutes of Health. “If caught early it might be extinguished with limited damage. If allowed to smolder, undetected, it can grow to an inferno that can spread quickly beyond our ability to control it.” To develop ideas, the Bush administration enlisted Dr. Hatchett, who had served as a White House biodefense policy adviser, and Dr. Mecher, who was a Veterans Affairs medical officer in Georgia overseeing care in the Southeast. “‘Someone from the White House is on the phone,’” Dr. Mecher, then 49, recalled his secretary telling him in the fall of 2005, her voice expressing some disbelief. A blunt-speaking, Chicago-born intensive care physician, Dr. Mecher had almost no pandemic policy expertise. Instead, he was recruited because they needed someone who understood how a hospital actually worked, said Dr. Rajeev Venkayya, who was a special assistant to Mr. Bush for biodefense. Dr. Koonin, who worked on preparedness planning at the C.D.C., also played a key role.“Strategic, out-of-the-box thinkers,” is how Dr. Venkayya, who now oversees vaccine production at Takeda, a Japan-based pharmaceutical company, described what he was looking for. The Social Network Given the increased danger from new strains of influenza and the reality that existing antiviral drugs like Tamiflu did not work against all contagious diseases, Drs. Hatchett and Mecher and their team began exploring other ways to combat a large-scale contagion. It was about that time that Dr. Mecher heard from Robert J. Glass, a senior scientist at Sandia in New Mexico who specialized in building advanced models to explain how complex systems work — and what can cause catastrophic failures. Dr. Glass’s daughter Laura, then 14, had done a class project in which she built a model of social networks at her Albuquerque high school, and when Dr. Glass looked at it, he was intrigued. Students are so closely tied together — in social networks and on school buses and in classrooms — that they were a near-perfect vehicle for a contagious disease to spread. Dr. Glass piggybacked on his daughter’s work to explore with her what effect breaking up these networks would have on knocking down the disease. The outcome of their research was startling. By closing the schools in a hypothetical town of 10,000 people, only 500 people got sick. If they remained open, half of the population would be infected. “My God, we could use the same results she has and work from there,” Dr. Glass recalled thinking. He took their preliminary data and built on it by running it through the supercomputers at Sandia, more typically used to engineer nuclear weapons. (His daughter’s project was entered in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2006.) Dr. Mecher received the results at his office in Washington and was amazed.If cities closed their public schools, the data suggested, the spread of a disease would be significantly slowed, making this move perhaps the most important of all of the social distancing options they were considering. “Targeted social distancing strategies can be designed to effectively mitigate the local progression of pandemic influenza without the use of vaccine or antiviral drugs,” concluded a study that Dr. Glass published in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. Laura, then a high school junior, got a credit. Drs. Hatchett and Mecher and their team soon found themselves measuring the width of the standard school bus seat and the average classroom size in the United States, calculating how closely spaced students are and agreeing that any plan would have to feature closing schools. At the same time, they were circling in on another fundamental challenge: If a government was going to rely on the blunt instrument of social distancing to prevent widespread death, how early would it have to act? A Lesson From the Past Dr. Markel had spent his career studying contagious disease outbreaks. Recently, he had been working on a related assignment from the Pentagon, which had a narrower but equally urgent concern: the vulnerability of U.S. military personnel to a viral health threat. Asia was hit in 2005 by a bird flu that crossed over to humans and spread to locations where the United States had forces stationed, including the Philippines. That led Dr. Markel to propose — after consulting a dictionary and thesaurus — what he called “protective sequestration,” like keeping military personnel in mass isolation on docked ships. The bird flu, while often fatal, did not continue to cross over in large numbers to humans, and the steps he was proposing turned out to be unnecessary. But the work led him to think about the need for a large-scale isolation plan for the United States. Dr. Markel had published a book, “When Germs Travel,” in 2004 that examined six major epidemics since 1900 and how they had traveled across the United States. He decided to work with Dr. Martin S. Cetron, the director of the C.D.C.’s quarantine division, to look more closely at the lessons of the Spanish flu of 1918. The research started with St. Louis, which had moved relatively quickly to head off the spread of the flu, and Philadelphia, which waited much longer and suffered far more. Officials in Philadelphia did not want to let the flu disrupt daily life, so they went ahead in September 1918 with a long planned parade that drew hundreds of thousands of spectators to promote war bonds. In St. Louis, by contrast, the city health commissioner quickly moved to close schools, churches, theaters, saloons, sporting events and other public gathering spots. Dr. Markel and his team set out to confirm just how important a role timing had played in reducing deaths. They gathered census records and thousands of other documents detailing the date of the first infection, the first death, the first social distancing policies and how long they were left in place in 43 American cities. Separately, Dr. Mecher and his team looked at the experience of 17 cities, using newspaper clips and other sources. Both teams came to the same conclusion and published papers on their findings within months of each other in 2007. Early, aggressive action to limit social interaction using multiple measures like closing schools or shutting down public gatherings was vital to limiting the death toll, they found. “It’s like treating heart-attack patients,” Dr. Mecher said. “Timing matters.”A High-Stakes Showdown After decades of advances by the nation’s pharmaceutical companies — finding treatments or vaccines for major illnesses, including H.I.V. and smallpox — Americans by the early 21st century had a built-in expectation that no matter what the ailment, there must be some kind of available fix. Locking your family inside your home seemed backward, and encouraging people not to go to work economically disastrous. The idea of forcibly limiting public assembly or movement had also long been seen as legally and ethically questionable. So the considerable skepticism among local officials, public health experts and policymakers in Washington was not surprising. One particularly vociferous critic was Dr. D.A. Henderson, who had been the leader of the international effort to eradicate smallpox and had been named by Mr. Bush to help oversee the nation’s biodefense efforts after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Dr. Henderson was convinced that it made no sense to force schools to close or public gatherings to stop. Teenagers would escape their homes to hang out at the mall. School lunch programs would close, and impoverished children would not have enough to eat. Hospital staffs would have a hard time going to work if their children were at home. The measures embraced by Drs. Mecher and Hatchett would “result in significant disruption of the social functioning of communities and result in possibly serious economic problems,” Dr. Henderson wrote in his own academic paper responding to their ideas. The answer, he insisted, was to tough it out: Let the pandemic spread, treat people who get sick and work quickly to develop a vaccine to prevent it from coming back. Caught in the middle, C.D.C. leaders decided to conduct more research and survey community leaders around the country. The administration ultimately sided with the proponents of social distancing and shutdowns — though their victory was little noticed outside of public health circles. Their policy would become the basis for government planning and would be used extensively in simulations used to prepare for pandemics, and in a limited way in 2009 during an outbreak of the influenza called H1N1. Then the coronavirus came, and the plan was put to work across the country for the first time.Dr. Mecher was a key voice on the “Red Dawn” email chain of public health experts in raising early warnings this year about the coronavirus outbreak and Mr. Trump’s reluctance to embrace shutdowns and social distancing. The shutdown this year is much bigger than Dr. Mecher and others imagined would be necessary or practical. Testing has been limited and some states issued social distancing orders even before confirming the coronavirus was spreading within their borders. Dr. Markel called it “very gratifying to see our work used to help save lives.” But, he added, “it is also horrifying.” “We always knew this would be applied in worst-case scenarios,” he said. “Even when you are working on dystopian concepts, you always hope it will never be used.”"
"As Leaders Urge Face Masks, Their Behavior Muffles the Message","WASHINGTON — When Vice President Mike Pence descended onto the tarmac in Colorado Springs last Saturday, his first appearance outside the White House grounds in over a month, he was greeted by the Democratic governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, who was wearing a face mask emblazoned with images from his state flag. Mr. Pence tapped elbows with Mr. Polis, rather than offering a hand, but he kept his face uncovered, a decision in line with President Trump’s position: Mr. Trump said this month that he would not follow guidelines from his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and wear a face mask. The tarmac photo opportunity between two elected officials in various states of facial undress underscored how politicians are, or aren’t, modeling the precautions they have recommended to their constituents. For the most part, top officials — from governors and mayors to Mr. Trump and his team — have chosen not to use masks, at least in public or at televised events, even as they encourage people to wear them. Some political analysts say image-conscious politicians may resist masks, even if they are warranted, for fear that the coverings might make them look pessimistic or nervous. But leaders inevitably risk looking hypocritical by preaching a message about masks and then forgoing, especially when they are surrounded by aides and others. Health experts say modeling behavior is the right thing for public officials to do. “If you’re instructing people to do stuff and you yourself aren’t doing it, that often sends the wrong message, and that’s an inconsistency in the guidance,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. For leaders who do seek to promote best practices, they face the possibility of appearing alien to Americans who have yet to grow accustomed to wearing masks. Bill de Blasio, the Democratic mayor of New York City, for instance, was mocked for looking like an “Old West bank robber” after covering his face with a bandanna while leaving a news conference this month. And Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican of Florida, committed a gaffe when he tried to put on an N95 mask in public and left one of the straps dangling from his chin. Political advisers acknowledged that more might go into the decision to don a mask than the advice of health experts. “Masks, whether worn by superheroes or villains, hide your identity,” said Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “Not always a good idea when you’re selling yourself.” The decision of whether to appear in public in a face mask does not seem to break down by political party, or by whether a lawmaker represents one of the hot spots of the outbreak. For instance, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, has been wearing a mask in public since the C.D.C. put out its recommendation, while Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat, has defended his decision not to cover his face during news conferences. Both governors lead states with widespread outbreaks of the coronavirus. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Democrat of Michigan, was photographed in a mask on April 14 while she toured an alternative care facility. Last weekend, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, a Democrat who recently issued an executive order requiring New Yorkers to wear a mask in many public places, was seen leaving his house for a walk with what appeared to be a bandanna tied around his face, the first time the public had seen him cover up. His rule of thumb, aides said, is to wear a mask or face covering, in public or in private, whenever he is less than six feet from anyone else. That doesn’t include his daily news conference, where reporters and government officials sit far apart from one another. Mr. DeSantis was slow to shut down his state but quicker to don a mask in public, being photographed wearing one on April 8. Several other governors have worn face coverings in public, including Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Jay Inslee of Washington, both Democrats. “I’ve been wearing a mask when I go out,” Mr. Pritzker told reporters on April 5, after entering the briefing room with his mouth and nose covered. “I did it this morning when I was out, and I did it when I came here.” Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, also a Democrat, said at a news conference this month that he had taken his mask off “because otherwise I’m not sure you’d be able to understand us.” “We’ll keep them on for the balance of any amount of time we’re remotely near anybody,” Mr. Murphy said. On Capitol Hill, many senators have not worn masks during their pro forma sessions. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican, was photographed in a surgical mask outside of the Senate on Monday, removing it to deliver his remarks on the Senate floor. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday simply pulled a blue patterned scarf over her face as she arrived at and departed her news conference. At the White House, aides have dismissed the few National Security Council officials who wear masks in the West Wing as “alarmists.” And Mr. Trump appeared to scoff at a reporter who tried to ask a question at a recent news conference while wearing a mask, saying he could “barely” hear his question. Administration officials also dismissed Mr. Polis’s decision to wear a mask while greeting Mr. Pence as a bit of political theater. (Mr. Polis’s office did not return a phone call on Tuesday.) The vice president, aides said, did not need to wear one because he is tested regularly for the coronavirus — a faulty argument, according to public health experts. “When the face-covering guidelines were developed, it was with the intention to not only protect yourself, but primarily to protect others from asymptomatic spread,” said Katie Miller, Mr. Pence’s spokeswoman. “Vice President Pence is negative for Covid-19 and is therefore not asymptomatic.” Mr. Pence could, of course, contract the virus between tests. More important, public health experts noted that the tests themselves were not infallible. Even in Covid-19 patients who are showing symptoms, diagnostic tests may detect the virus only 75 percent of the time, said Dr. Mark Loeb, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at McMaster University, and it isn’t clear how sensitive the tests are in asymptomatic cases. “We don’t actually have the estimates for the sensitivity, the ability to rule out false negatives, for asymptomatic testing,” Dr. Loeb said. “So it’s certainly something, but it doesn’t necessarily rule out infection.” At a White House news conference on Monday night, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator, also emphasized that tests were not always reliable. Other experts said that, while preventing asymptomatic transmission is the medical goal of the guidelines on masks, it is not the only reason for public officials to wear them. By wearing masks in public, officials model the behavior they are asking citizens to adopt and can help influence people to take the guidelines seriously. There is disagreement within the medical community on how effective cloth masks — as opposed to surgical or N95 masks — are in preventing asymptomatic transmission, Dr. Adalja said, but “if you’re part of a team that’s actually advocating people to wear those masks, then I think it becomes odd if you’re not wearing a mask.” Mr. Trump undercut the mask recommendation even as he announced it on April 3, emphasizing repeatedly that it was voluntary. “You can do it,” he said. “You don’t have to do it. I am choosing not to do it.”“Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens — I don’t know,” he added. “Somehow, I don’t see it for myself.”Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Astor from New York.

The Virus Won’t Revive F.D.R.’s Arts Jobs Program. Here’s Why.,"In the loft above the pickle factory, dozens of women sat each day at looms or hovered around copper-lined tanks filled with dye, weaving drapes and rugs for the government. It was San Francisco, in the early 1940s, and Margery Magnani, a 20-something French literature major, somehow found herself the forewoman, supervising as many as 95 workers. Most of them were old enough to be her mother or grandmother. Some sewed cut-up old military uniforms together by hand. Others hung the finished fabrics over large poles so they would become crisp and presentable. The younger women worked the 75-gallon tanks, dyeing about 25 pounds of yarn a day into shades of deep red or green. The material would end up as rugs, or drapes for an Army club, or decorations for the venereal disease clinic. The work usually went without a hitch — except for when the dye would drip down into the pickles below. “These people would come upstairs, just screaming their heads off because all of a sudden there was red and blue water trickling down,” Ms. Magnani said in an oral history recorded by the Smithsonian’s Archives of American Art. These weavers were part of a federal jobs program launched in another uncertain time and designed to employ painters and sculptors, actors, musicians, writers and craftspeople who were having a hard time making a living. For roughly a decade, starting with the Depression of the 1930s, a generation of artists received their paychecks from the government under the auspices of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal. They did jobs like teaching art to children or painting murals for schools and post offices.“On the whole they were united by one very simple, basic thing: They needed to eat,” said Burgoyne Diller, a mural supervisor for the Federal Art Project, in an oral history. There is talk again in some circles of fashioning additional federal help for artists as the pandemic wreaks havoc on their livelihoods. Some lawmakers, for example, wanted $4 billion in emergency funding for the arts included in the stimulus package. “There are going to be a lot of people out of work who make their living as a musician, people working for community theaters,” said Representative Chellie Pingree, a Maine Democrat and leader of the Congressional Arts Caucus, last month. “You can’t turn your back on them.” But few defenders of the arts are optimistic that a program as sprawling and generous as the New Deal initiative could happen now. “I’m not sure you can get Congress to agree on anything,” said Barbara Bernstein, founder of the New Deal Art Registry, an online guide to art from that era. “Especially not something as easy to make fun of as an art program.” For one, President Trump has cast himself as an arts antagonist, at least when it comes to funding. In each of his budget proposals as president, he has called for the elimination of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. And he has no shortage of allies, some of whom view the arts as elitist and others who say that, however valuable, cultural matters should not be the work of government. Nikki Haley, the Republican former United Nations ambassador, reacted with criticism when Congress finalized the $2 trillion emergency aid bill in March and set aside $250 million for the arts, including the N.E.A., the N.E.H., and public television and radio — less than 7 percent of what lawmakers like Representative Pingree had pushed for. “How many more people could have been helped with this money?” she tweeted.The mood was different when the New Deal program passed. Certainly conservatives of that era viewed some artists as dangerously radical leftists, but Roosevelt’s program was a minor part of a major initiative that included money for projects like new roads and bridges. It was pushed by a popular president whose party controlled both houses of Congress. And it came at a time when some in the government saw the morale-boosting benefits of creating a truly “American” artistic style, one no longer derivative of Europe, said Ms. Bernstein. During that era, so many programs disbursed arts funding under a parade of acronyms that even the artists who had benefited couldn’t keep the names straight. The Farm Security Administration, for example, was the unlikely sounding source of projects that produced famous photographs like Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother” and Gordon Parks’s “American Gothic.” But the engine of the arts funding was the Works Progress Administration’s Federal Art Project. It financed roughly 2,500 murals, 18,800 pieces of sculpture and 108,000 easel works. Thousands of original poster designs were created to advertise local zoos and library book talks or encourage people to get tested for syphilis and report dog bites. Federal Project Number One — an umbrella program for arts funding that was allocated $27 million in 1935 — surfaced in time to support the work of Berenice Abbott. An Ohio-born photographer, she had an ambitious idea that involved photographing the sprawl of the city. She had, unsuccessfully, sent out hundreds of letters asking for funding. “But 1929 was not a year for anyone to start new enterprises,” Ms. Abbott wrote in “Art for the Millions,” a collection of essays by New Deal artists and arts administrators. Later, with federal funding, Ms. Abbott set up her camera in crowded streets, on rickety fire escapes and on perilous rooftops to capture the architectural sweep of the city in the 1930s, calling the product “Changing New York.” The artist Charles Alston also found himself adrift after graduating from Columbia College the same year as the stock market crash. “You lived a secluded life on the campus; that’s your world,” Mr. Alston said in a 1965 oral history. “Then you come out and the whole thing has fallen down around your ears.” Mr. Alston eventually became a supervisor on a federally funded project to install murals at Harlem Hospital Center. In 1936, he composed his own — an intricate, sepia-toned diptych — for the lobby of the hospital’s new women’s pavilion. On one panel (“Magic in Medicine”), he illustrated traditional healing practices, as well as a ritual Fang reliquary sculpture from Gabon in Central Africa; on the other (“Modern Medicine”), he depicted a microscope and doctors wearing white scrub caps. Mr. Alston recalled standing in line waiting for his government check, sometimes in the rain or snow or freezing cold, with artists like Stuart Davis and Arshile Gorky. (He described Mr. Gorky as a “saturnine-looking chap” in his long black coat, wide black hat and large mustache.) The ritual helped create a collective identify among the artists. The Harlem Artists Guild would meet to discuss their artistic quandaries and to pressure the Works Progress Administration to hire more black artists. Mr. Alston’s studio on 143rd Street served as a gathering place for raucous debates between artists and writers like Ralph Ellison and Claude McKay — the vast majority of them united by their participation in government art projects. Naturally, the egos and political beliefs of these artists sometimes clashed with what was expected of a government worker. Government timekeepers would show up where artists worked to make sure they were on the clock. But some artists preferred to paint at night, said Mr. Diller, a mural supervisor in New York, and the timekeepers would find them fast asleep in the middle of the day. “We worked day and night and weekends, and, believe me, we were not well-paid for it,” Mr. Diller said in a 1964 oral history, “but we thought it was the most wonderful thing that could be happening.” Then there was the art that was nearly suppressed because it ruffled feathers.Plans for Mr. Alston’s mural at Harlem Hospital Center nearly ground to a halt when the hospital’s superintendent objected to a sketch that showed health care workers of different races working together. Mr. Alston remembered the superintendent saying that the institution “wasn’t a Negro hospital.” But with the support of the Artists Union and sympathetic hospital employees, the mural went up. In 1937, the Works Progress Administration shut down “The Cradle Will Rock,” a so-called “play in music” that was written by Marc Blitzstein and directed by Orson Welles as part of the Federal Theater Project. The agency said the decision was a result of bureaucratic reorganization and budget cuts. But many accused the government of censoring the Broadway production because it told a pro-union story about workers in a steel town organizing against their villainous boss. Uniformed W.P.A. guards demanded that all the show’s costumes, props and set pieces remain in the building because they were considered government property. That pushed the show into scrambling to find a privately funded venue, which it eventually did. On the night of the first scheduled performance, Blitzstein played the music on a piano in the center of the stage, while cast members sang their parts from the audience as a way to circumvent restrictions from the actors’ union. (Welles resigned from the theater project over the episode.) In assessing the legacy of these programs, there have long been divisions over whether the New Deal was too uniform and utopian in its vision of America. Much of the art focused on bucolic depictions of American scenery or, as the art historian Francis V. O’Connor wrote, of the “earnest worker and his handsome family” living in “blissful diligence in well-planned communities.” Then, when the United States entered World War II, certain segments of the programs were repurposed to promote the government’s efforts, with the artists spitting out posters urging people to buy war bonds or “sew for victory” or simply promoting patriotism. Still, there were plenty of examples of unfettered artistic expression.At the post office in Plymouth, Pa., for example, there is a mural called “Meal Time With the Early Coal Miners” by Jared French, in which a group of well-muscled miners — most of them shirtless and wearing skintight pants — wash near aquamarine water, towel off and spread out food on the grass. On the far right, a nude man stands in a boat with what appears to be a hat positioned over his groin. “People go to the post office to buy their stamps,” Ms. Bernstein said, “and there’s a piece of homoerotic art on the wall.” As the New Deal art funding programs continued, opposition to them grew, and many of the arguments resemble today’s debate. The Federal Theater Project became a symbol of congressional ire toward the so-called “boondoggling,” or wasteful spending, of the New Deal. In 1938, the program found itself under the microscope of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Lawmakers charged that the project was being infiltrated by Communists in New York, staging plays with socialist messaging and employing untrained people who pretended to be actors. The next year, Congress eliminated the theater project and shifted responsibility for the other arts projects to the states. The opposition included conservative Democrats from the South and it signaled the beginning of the end for New Deal art funding. The entry of the United States into World War II pushed down unemployment numbers, making large-scale employment programs obsolete. The federal arts funding officially ended in 1943. “It’s rather remarkable that it did last until 1943,” said David Woolner, a senior fellow at the Roosevelt Institute. “In today’s political climate — given the deep partisan divide — trying to put through such a program would be very difficult.”"
Tehran Launches Military Satellite as Trump Tells Navy to ‘Shoot Down’ Iranian Boats,"WASHINGTON — Iran successfully put into orbit what it called its first “military satellite” on Wednesday, after a string of previous failures, just hours before President Trump declared he had instructed the Navy to sink any Iranian fast boats that “harass our ships at sea.” The order, if followed, could sharply escalate the confrontations between the two nations. While Iran was vague about the military capabilities of the satellite, the launch was notable in part because it originated from a mobile launch vehicle, similar to the kind the North Koreans are using to demonstrate they have the ability to roll out a missile and send it into space before the United States or its allies have time to respond. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo immediately condemned the launch as a violation of a United Nations Security Council resolution and declared that Iran would be “held accountable,” but did not specify what that meant. As the C.I.A. director, Mr. Pompeo ordered an acceleration of a secret American program to sabotage Iranian launches. But after a string of major failures, the launch on Wednesday marked an unusual success, one Iranian television hailed with pictures of officers from the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, many wearing masks, in a celebration in a control room. The president’s abrupt tweet authorizing a far looser standard for the Navy to fire on Iranian fast boats seemed to take the Pentagon by surprise. Under the Navy’s rules of engagement, lethal force can be used only if American ships or personnel are put at risk — for example, by trying to ram a U.S. warship or place explosives near its hull. But blaring loudspeakers and weaving in the ship’s path, all part of the standard harassment techniques used by swarms of Iranian small boats, are not considered legally sufficient to open a salvo that could escalate into war. Last week the Pentagon accused Iran of sending 11 fast boats to conduct “dangerous and harassing approaches” to six American warships in the Persian Gulf, and that appeared to be what led to the president’s warning “to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea.” The statement came after Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, tweeted last week that the United States had “been too lenient in responding” to Iranian provocations. As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump declared that when the Iranians “circle our beautiful destroyers with their little boats” they would be “shot out of the water.” Taken together, the satellite launch and the warning to Iran suggest the two countries are escalating their episodic confrontations, even as both nations are fighting the coronavirus. And they may both have reasons: At home, the Iranian government and Mr. Trump’s administration have been criticized for mismanaging the response to the virus, and leaders in both nations may calculate that there is an advantage to reigniting confrontations with old adversaries. While the swarming of small boats is a striking visual sign of those confrontations, the missile launch may well prove the more significant action. Iran’s civilian and military space programs — which American officials contend are closely related — have been plagued by mysterious explosions, failed launches and satellites that never deployed correctly. Roughly two-thirds of their orbital launches have failed, though it has never been clear how much of that has been a result of bad luck or technical incompetence, and how much has been caused by active American and Israeli sabotage programs. Mr. Trump even tweeted out last summer a classified American satellite image of the burned remnants of a failed space launch, taunting the Iranians by declaring that “I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened.” But on Wednesday, what happened appeared to be a rare Iranian success — one Tehran said was the inauguration of its equivalent of the Pentagon’s new Space Force. That seemed a vast overstatement: It is unclear that the new satellite is transmitting images, or even how good they are compared with what is available on Google Earth and commercial satellite services. Still, Mr. Pompeo confirmed the launch and noted that the government in Tehran had always claimed its satellite launches were only for commercial purposes and had no military use. That all reversed on Wednesday. “I think today’s launch proves what we’ve been saying all along here in the United States,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters at the State Department. “I think Iran needs to be held accountable for what it’s done.” Because the lofting of a satellite into orbit mimics some of the flight path of a nuclear warhead, such launches have long been considered akin to practice runs. The United Nations resolution Mr. Pompeo referred to does not explicitly prohibit such launches; instead, watered-down language agreed to as part of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal says that Iran is “called upon” to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons, for up to eight years. Iran insists it is not working on a nuclear weapon, and thus none of its missiles are designed to be “nuclear capable.” The appearance of the mobile launcher struck both American and Israeli officials as a major advance. Previously Iran has launched its satellites from fixed sites, which are easy to strike before a launch. But the photos and video of this launch showed a mobile launcher similar to what the North Koreans have increasingly used. The system reduces warning time, and thus makes it harder to pre-empt a launch. For the Revolutionary Guards, the launch has other symbolic value. The force had overall responsibility for the Iranian nuclear program, and some elements of the group have pressed for Iran to completely withdraw from the agreement — as Mr. Trump has — and to speed the restoration of its program. But so far the Iranian government has been proceeding methodically, hoping to split the European nations, China and Russia from the United States. A year ago the Trump administration designated the Revolutionary Guards as a foreign terrorist organization, the first time the United States named part of another nation’s government as that type of official threat. In early January, American drones killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who headed the Quds Force, an elite unit of the Revolutionary Guards, drastically escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran. Since then, however, tensions have de-escalated, and there was a theory that the coronavirus would distract Iran’s attentions, and its budgets. But there is little evidence that is the case. Mr. Pompeo, speaking at the State Department, dismissed the importance of Mr. Trump’s tweet about sinking Iranian fast boats for harassing U.S. naval ships, noting that the president had previously given senior American officials authority to “take whatever action is necessary to make sure you can defend and keep our people safe.” But a tweet does not constitute a military order, and a Defense Department official said the Navy had not received any formal policy directive from Mr. Trump ordering it to change its criteria for opening fire on Iranian gunboats. A U.S. military official said there had been no further incidents with the Iranians, fast boats or otherwise, since the one last week, when the Pentagon said Iranian boats “repeatedly crossed the bows and sterns” of Navy ships at high speeds, at one point coming within about 10 yards. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, David L. Norquist, the deputy defense secretary, said Mr. Trump’s statement on Twitter was more of a warning to the Iranians than a change to the current rules of engagement. “The president issued an important warning to the Iranians. What he was emphasizing is that all of our ships retain the right of self-defense,” Mr. Norquist said. “The president is describing and responding to poor behavior of the Iranians.” Standing alongside Mr. Norquist, Gen. John E. Hyten, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he liked “that the president warned an adversary.” Mr. Trump has a history of Twitter announcements that seem at odds with traditional policy, including that involving the military and its rules and operations. Liberal critics of the president have suggested that, facing low approval ratings for his handling of the coronavirus response, Mr. Trump is searching for other ways to change the subject, demonstrate leadership and energize his conservative base. American military units on the ground and at sea abide by strict rules on “escalation of force,” a ladder that includes audible warnings, flares and maneuvers before a shot is fired, often as a last measure. Mr. Trump’s directive, in many ways, discounts this entire process and could lead to injury and death on an already crowded, and often confusing, waterway such as the Persian Gulf. “Commanders are well aware and already have sufficient guidance to deal with these types of events,” said Vice Adm. John W. Miller, a retired commander of the Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain. The Trump administration has continued to impose its “maximum pressure” campaign of economic sanctions against Iran after the United States withdrew from the nuclear agreement. Tehran, for its part, has launched proxy attacks against American troops, interests and allies in the region. The Revolutionary Guards Corps, which commands the fast boats, is a paramilitary organization, separate from Iran’s conventional military. The organization carries out operations across the Middle East, trains Arab Shiite militias and oversees businesses in Iran.Reporting was contributed by Thomas Gibbons-Neff, Lara Jakes and Michael Crowley from Washington; Ronen Bergman from Tel Aviv; and Farnaz Fassihi from New York."
On Politics: Trump Gives Green Cards a Red Light,"Good morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday. Where things standPresident Trump declared yesterday that he would temporarily halt the issuance of green cards, a drastic move to cut immigration but not quite the all-out ban that he had threatened on Twitter the night before. The headline-grabbing action may shift public focus, at least temporarily, away from coronavirus-related debates over medical supplies and virus testing — disputes that have put Trump at odds with governors and his own health officials. But according to people familiar with the immigration announcement, officials at the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security were caught off guard by Trump’s plan. And on Tuesday night, with the executive order not yet finalized, they were still evaluating whether the president had the legal authority to unilaterally stop green cards from being issued.The Senate on Tuesday passed the next phase of coronavirus relief, a $484 billion piece of legislation that will replenish the small-business loan program established last month as well as allocate funds for hospitals and virus testing. In a significant concession to House Democrats, Trump and his Republican allies agreed to include a nationwide framework to help states and local governments effectively manage their testing programs. The House is expected to pass the legislation on Thursday, sending it to Trump for approval. The bill is meant as a stopgap measure, with much larger legislation — in the ballpark of $1 trillion — expected to be taken up in the weeks ahead.Trump has claimed for years that findings of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election are largely false, the work of a “deep state” inside the intelligence community that is out to get him. But a newly released report by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee directly contradicts Trump’s denials, affirming that intelligence officials were right to blame Russia for interfering in the election and for seeking to undermine American democracy. “The committee found no reason to dispute the intelligence community’s conclusions,” said Richard Burr, a Republican senator from North Carolina and the committee’s chairman.A pandemic is a very hard time to be raising money, but as the Democrats’ presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden is going to have to find a way to do it. And fast. He and the Democratic National Committee are almost $187 million behind Trump and the Republican Party as they pivot toward the general election, according to financial disclosure filings. Throughout the Democratic primary race, Biden’s fund-raising operation often lagged behind some of his rivals’, and his campaign organization was often seen as being relatively disorganized. There are signs these issues could continue to dog him: More than a month after a string of decisive primary victories have made his nomination all but certain, Biden still has not struck an agreement to collect big checks in concert with the Democratic National Committee. And he has been slow to expand hiring or to commit to an overall digital campaign strategy; Biden’s digital operation, at roughly 25 employees, is less than a quarter the size of Trump’s, Politico reported.Jay Inslee, the liberal governor of Washington State, endorsed Biden on Wednesday — a meaningful if not altogether surprising embrace from one of the country’s most prominent environmentalists. Inslee briefly ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last year, and on the campaign trail he criticized Biden for not having a sufficiently ambitious climate policy. But Inslee told our reporter Alexander Burns that in private conversations over the past few weeks, Biden had persuaded him that he was “willing to aim faster and higher” than before in the fight against climate change. “I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that this will be a major driving force of his administration,” Inslee said.

Milwaukee confirms coronavirus cases after Wisconsin’s elections.By Reid J. EpsteinTwo weeks after Republicans in Wisconsin’s State Legislature forced the state to hold in-person elections, Milwaukee health officials announced the first cases of voters testing positive for the coronavirus. Milwaukee officials said that six people who voted in the elections and one poll worker had tested positive for the virus, seeming to validate the warnings of state public health officials who had said that in-person voting in the April 7 elections could put lives at risk. While Wisconsin Republicans have said that they have no interest in making voting by mail easier for the November general election, Milwaukee aldermen on Tuesday voted unanimously to send ballots to every registered voter in the city — a move that could increase turnout in the predominately Democratic city. It’s likely to be met by legal challenges from Republicans. In the meantime, Wisconsin is set to hold yet another in-person vote, a May 12 special election to fill a House seat from the part of the state known as Up North. Plans are for polls to open in 20 counties, as they did statewide this month. On Politics is also available as a newsletter.

When Mom’s Zoom Meeting Is the One That Has to Wait,"LOS ANGELES — As soon as she began planning to work from home, Saba Lurie knew she would need to make major adjustments in how she operates her private psychotherapy practice, from counseling patients through a screen to managing her staff remotely. She also quickly realized that, because her husband earns a higher salary, the bulk of the domestic work would fall on her. The aggravations added up quickly: Her bathroom became an emergency office. “It’s the one place I can close the door and lock it,” she said. Her husband, unaccustomed to balancing his workday schedule with hers, forgot to tell her about some of his conference calls, leaving Ms. Lurie scrambling to figure out how to tend to their two daughters, ages 4 and 1. Her practice, which she spent years building, has been pushed aside.“The responsibility to deal is on me,” Ms. Lurie said. And many of her clients have told her the same thing. “What I am hearing is that we as women are going to be the ones to set boundaries or establish a plan.” Ms. Lurie and her clients are part of a generation of professional women who had arranged their domestic lives, however precariously, to enable full-time careers and parenthood. They are facing this crisis in the midst of high-intensity parenting years, and a crucial moment for growing and establishing their work. Now, able to set up shop remotely, but with schools closed and child care gone, the pandemic is forcing them to confront the bruising reality of gender dynamics as the country is trapped at home. Even before the coronavirus crisis, women spent about four hours a day on unpaid work, like laundry, grocery shopping and cleaning, compared with about 2.5 hours for men, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That labor has expanded exponentially in recent weeks, as Americans home-school their children and help older family members and friends more vulnerable to the virus. In interviews with more than a dozen women who work as lawyers, writers, architects, teachers, nurses and nonprofit administrators, many said that they were grateful to have some child care help pre-quarantine, and that they could work from home. But they have been slightly stunned to learn that they are expected to organize and manage every domestic need for their family, while maintaining a full-time professional career as part of a dual career couple. It was feminism of earlier generations, after all, that declared “the personal is political.” So the fact that the crisis hit after stinging political defeats for female presidential candidates adds to the uncomfortable reckoning for many Democratic women — even if they had decided themselves that the most viable way to defeat President Trump was to support a male candidate. When Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the presidential race, Gretchen Newsom sat in her car and burst into tears. Six weeks later, Ms. Warren backed her onetime political rival Joseph R. Biden Jr., and Ms. Newsom is working, parenting and teaching as a single mother. And, as the political director for the San Diego chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, she is struggling around the clock to answer fearful questions from union members. “It is kind of a slap in the face, we’re doing all of this and yet we have so little representation,” she said. While the political disappointment may be most acute among liberal women, the bargain is bipartisan. Indeed, it is the kind of “lean in” feminism embraced by people like Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter — whose 2017 book “Women Who Work” essentially told women to get enough help to do it all — that is facing perhaps one of the most jarring shifts. It’s also an economic struggle, long clear in the lives of women who earn lower wages, that feminist political leaders have criticized for years. “It’s like our economy is this house of cards for women and it is just toppling down,” says Cecile Richards, a founder of SuperMajority, a new political organization aimed at energizing female voters. “All of the structural problems that we’ve all known intellectually you can now see in pretty much every woman’s daily life.” Now, those who are able to work from home have created new offices in cars, spare closets and, like Ms. Lurie, bathrooms. Millions of others, like nurses and home health aides, find themselves on the front lines of battling the virus, facing serious health risks. And with women making up nearly two-thirds of minimum-wage jobs, a majority in the service industry, many have lost their income entirely. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than one-third of working women, compared with just 15.7 percent of working men, are employed in two industries that have been significantly affected by the virus: the health care and social assistance industry and the leisure and hospitality industry. In both fields, women are paid less than their male peers, according to research by the Economic Policy Institute. “I hope we rethink a lot of structures after this,” said Candace Valenzuela, a Democratic congressional candidate from the suburbs of Dallas. “My hope is that coming out of this crisis we rethink compensation for both women and for people who traditionally get minimum-wage work.” Until March, Ms. Valenzuela spent hours calling donors from her campaign headquarters. Now, she is at home caring for her sons, ages 4 and 1. Her mother-in-law, who lives with the family and often helps with the children, has fallen ill, and though it is uncertain if the coronavirus is the culprit, she is quarantined in a different part of the house. With space at a premium, Ms. Valenzuela cleared her curling iron off the counter, brought in a yoga ball and turned her bathroom into a makeshift office for the foreseeable future. Ms. Valenzuela considers herself lucky because her children are young enough that she is avoiding home-school. And her husband had already taken on much of the household duties since she began her campaign last year. Still, she said: “The way we’ve been able to MacGyver a career as a woman is completely under attack by a global pandemic.” The crisis has become a moment for some to reconsider how much progress has taken place on a societal level. Ms. Lurie, the therapist, recalled the day she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, holding her year-old daughter. Since then, she said, “it has just been having to recalibrate, recalibrate and recalibrate. What I promised my daughters isn’t something I can deliver and that’s such a painful thing to consider.” Dori Howard, who helps run a women’s co-working space in Los Angeles, said she viewed the pandemic as sending feminism back to the “1950s with women stuck at home.” Many friends and colleagues, she said, have put professional projects on hold because their husbands have the higher income. Indeed, research shows that women with children often face a significant drop in earnings after having a child, but there is no similar drop for men. “Of course their husbands make more money than they do — because of the wage gap,” Ms. Howard said. “It’s a cycle of despair.” The new set of challenges comes as more American families are likely to be dependent on a female breadwinner. Mothers are the primary or sole earners for 40 percent of households with children under 18 today, compared with 18 percent in 1987. Nearly a quarter of families are headed by a single mother, the second most common family arrangement in America after living with two parents. Aireka Muse, a television writer in Los Angeles who gave birth to her first child six months ago, has taken to working on her latest project from her parked car. The other day, she said, when she walked back up to the family’s one-bedroom apartment, her husband asked, “When are you going to be done?” “For him there was a limit to the time and a box for being more responsible for our child,” she said. “But me taking care of my son is not circumstantial. I’m never going to be done — there’s always going to be another project and there is always going to be my son.” Ms. Muse has some hope that the quarantine experience — and the up-close look at parenting, professional work and keeping everyone fed and healthy — could shift some men’s perspectives, especially those who identify as feminist but might not be first in line to call the pediatrician. “At least for my husband, they are more hyperaware of the work that their wives have been doing, and something has got to give,” she said. “Instead of just running on automatic pilot, I wonder if it is eye-opening for them?” Late last month, Representative Katie Porter, a freshman Democrat from California, found herself trying to self-quarantine in her bedroom after exposure to the virus, while spending around seven hours each day on conference calls. At the same time, Ms. Porter, a single mother to three school-aged children, was trying to keep up with the distance learning requirements for three different grades. “When the email says, ‘Make sure your student does A,’ I don’t even know which student they’re talking about,” she said. “It was overwhelming.” Ms. Porter is trying to channel some of her personal frustration into political action, raising alarms about the level of stimulus payments disbursed to single parents and pushing for legislation that would expand the amount employees can put in tax-free dependent care accounts. Amy Pompeii, 46, has managed to juggle working as a nurse at Ohio State’s Wexner Medical Center with being a single mother since her husband died nearly a decade ago. With her daughter, a college sophomore, now at home, Ms. Pompeii has help to care for her 10-year-old son. “A lot of my co-workers do not have that luxury,” she said. So far, the hospital where she works has not been inundated with patients battling the virus, but her children still worry. “We are all under a very stressful situation, but the men I work with, for the most part, they go home and decompress, do something to clear their mind,” Ms. Pompeii said. “We don’t get to do that.” In therapy sessions with his clients over the past few weeks, Avi Klein has heard all sorts of domestic frustrations — a divorced father desperate to see more of his children, a high-salaried husband who is trying to carve out time for his wife’s graduate studies, and women whose less flexible jobs are taking precedence over their partners’. But among heterosexual couples, the most common scenario is that women are taking on the emotional and care-taking labor, according to Mr. Klein, whose client base is male and whose own wife takes care of their three children while he runs his practice out of the family’s home in New Paltz, N.Y. Mostly, Mr. Klein said, people remain in survival mode: “What everyone is doing is impossible and crazy.” But whenever the chaos subsides, he said, “this has to reshape our views of gender in a meaningful way.” “To spend this much time at home, to have this experience of taking care of a family will change us,” he added. “We will have to all have a better sense of what we are asking our partners to do.”Jennifer Medina reported from Los Angeles and Lisa Lerer reported from Washington."
"Chinese Agents Helped Spread Messages That Sowed Virus Panic in U.S., Officials Say","WASHINGTON — The alarming messages came fast and furious in mid-March, popping up on the cellphone screens and social media feeds of millions of Americans grappling with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Spread the word, the messages said: The Trump administration was about to lock down the entire country. “They will announce this as soon as they have troops in place to help prevent looters and rioters,” warned one of the messages, which cited a source in the Department of Homeland Security. “He said he got the call last night and was told to pack and be prepared for the call today with his dispatch orders.” The messages became so widespread over 48 hours that the White House’s National Security Council issued an announcement via Twitter that they were “FAKE.” Since that wave of panic, United States intelligence agencies have assessed that Chinese operatives helped push the messages across platforms, according to six American officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to publicly discuss intelligence matters. The amplification techniques are alarming to officials because the disinformation showed up as texts on many Americans’ cellphones, a tactic that several of the officials said they had not seen before. That has spurred agencies to look at new ways in which China, Russia and other nations are using a range of platforms to spread disinformation during the pandemic, they said. The origin of the messages remains murky. American officials declined to reveal details of the intelligence linking Chinese agents to the dissemination of the disinformation, citing the need to protect their sources and methods for monitoring Beijing’s activities. The officials interviewed for this article work in six different agencies. They included both career civil servants and political appointees, and some have spent many years analyzing China. Their broader warnings about China’s spread of disinformation are supported by recent findings from outside bipartisan research groups, including the Alliance for Securing Democracy and the Center for a New American Security, which is expected to release a report on the topic next month. Two American officials stressed they did not believe Chinese operatives created the lockdown messages, but rather amplified existing ones. Those efforts enabled the messages to catch the attention of enough people that they then spread on their own, with little need for further work by foreign agents. The messages appeared to gain significant traction on Facebook as they were also proliferating through texts, according to an analysis by The New York Times. American officials said the operatives had adopted some of the techniques mastered by Russia-backed trolls, such as creating fake social media accounts to push messages to sympathetic Americans, who in turn unwittingly help spread them. The officials say the Chinese agents also appear to be using texts and encrypted messaging apps as part of their campaigns. It is much harder for researchers and law enforcement officers to track disinformation spread through text messages and encrypted apps than on social media platforms. American intelligence officers are also examining whether spies in China’s diplomatic missions in the United States helped spread the fake lockdown messages, a senior American official said. American agencies have recently increased their scrutiny of Chinese diplomats and employees of state-run media organizations. In September, the State Department secretly expelled two employees of the Chinese Embassy in Washington suspected of spying. Other rival powers might have been involved in the dissemination, too. And Americans with prominent online or news media platforms unknowingly helped amplify the messages. Misinformation has proliferated during the pandemic — in recent weeks, some pro-Trump news outlets have promoted anti-American conspiracy theories, including one that suggests the virus was created in a laboratory in the United States. American officials said China, borrowing from Russia’s strategies, has been trying to widen political divisions in the United States. As public dissent simmers over lockdown policies in several states, officials worry it will be easy for China and Russia to amplify the partisan disagreements. “It is part of the playbook of spreading division,” said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, adding that private individuals have identified some social media bots that helped promote the recent lockdown protests that some fringe conservative groups have nurtured. The propaganda efforts go beyond text messages and social media posts directed at Americans. In China, top officials have issued directives to agencies to engage in a global disinformation campaign around the virus, the American officials said. Some American intelligence officers are especially concerned about disinformation aimed at Europeans that pro-China actors appear to have helped spread. The messages stress the idea of disunity among European nations during the crisis and praise China’s “donation diplomacy,” American officials said. Left unmentioned are reports of Chinese companies delivering shoddy equipment and European leaders expressing skepticism over China’s handling of its outbreak. Mr. Trump himself has shown little concern about China’s actions. He has consistently praised the handling of the pandemic by Chinese leaders — “Much respect!” he wrote on Twitter on March 27. Three days later, he dismissed worries over China’s use of disinformation when asked about it on Fox News. “They do it and we do it and we call them different things,” he said. “Every country does it.”Asked about the new accusations, the Chinese Foreign Ministry released a statement on Tuesday that said, “The relevant statements are complete nonsense and not worth refuting.” Zhao Lijian, a ministry spokesman, has separately rebutted persistent accusations by American officials that China has supplied bad information and exhibited a broader lack of transparency during the pandemic. “We urge the U.S. to stop political manipulation, get its own house in order and focus more on fighting the epidemic and boosting the economy,” Mr. Zhao said at a news conference on Friday. An Information WarThe United States and China are engaged in a titanic information war over the pandemic, one that has added a new dimension to their global rivalry. President Trump and his aides are trying to put the spotlight on China as they face intense criticism over the federal government’s widespread failures in responding to the pandemic, which has killed more than 40,000 Americans. President Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party are trying to shore up domestic and international support after earlier cover-ups that allowed the virus to spread. As diplomatic tensions rose and Beijing scrambled to control the narrative, the Chinese government last month expelled American journalists for three U.S. news organizations, including The Times. The extent to which the United States might be engaging in its own covert information warfare in China is not clear. While the C.I.A. in recent decades has tried to support pro-democracy opposition figures in some countries, Chinese counterintelligence officers eviscerated the agency’s network of informants in China about a decade ago, hurting its ability to conduct operations there. Chinese officials accuse Mr. Trump and his allies of overtly peddling malicious or bad information, pointing to the president’s repeatedly calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or the suggestion by some Republicans that the virus may have originated as a Chinese bioweapon, a theory that U.S. intelligence agencies have since ruled out. (Many Americans have also criticized Mr. Trump’s language as racist.) Republican strategists have decided that bashing China over the virus will shore up support for Mr. Trump and other conservative politicians before the November elections. Given the toxic information environment, foreign policy analysts are worried that the Trump administration may politicize intelligence work or make selective leaks to promote an anti-China narrative. Those concerns hover around the speculation over the origin of the virus. American officials in the past have selectively passed intelligence to reporters to shape the domestic political landscape; the most notable instance was under President George W. Bush in the run-up to the Iraq War. But it has been clear for more than a month that the Chinese government is pushing disinformation and anti-American conspiracy theories related to the pandemic. Mr. Zhao, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, wrote on Twitter in March that the U.S. Army might have taken the virus to the Chinese city of Wuhan. That message was then amplified by the official Twitter accounts of Chinese embassies and consulates. The state-run China Global Television Network produced a video targeting viewers in the Middle East in which a presenter speaking Arabic asserted that “some new facts” indicated that the pandemic might have originated from American participants in a military sports competition in October in Wuhan. The network has an audience of millions, and the video has had more than 365,000 views on YouTube. “What we’ve seen is the C.C.P. mobilizing its global messaging apparatus, which includes state media as well as Chinese diplomats, to push out selected and localized versions of the same overarching false narratives,” Lea Gabrielle, coordinator of the Global Engagement Center in the State Department, said in late March, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. Some analysts say it is core to China’s new, aggressive “‘Wolf Warrior’ diplomacy,” a term that refers to a patriotic Chinese military action film series. But Chinese diplomats and operators of official media accounts recently began moving away from overt disinformation, Ms. Gabrielle said. That dovetailed with a tentative truce Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi reached over publicly sniping about the virus. American officials said Chinese agencies are most likely embracing covert propagation of disinformation in its place. Current and former American officials have said they are seeing Chinese operatives adopt online strategies long used by Russian agents — a phenomenon that also occurred during the Hong Kong protests last year. Some Chinese operatives have promoted disinformation that originated on Russia-aligned websites, they said. And the apparent aim of spreading the fake lockdown messages last month is consistent with a type of disinformation favored by Russian actors — namely sowing chaos and undermining confidence among Americans in the U.S. government, the officials said. “As Beijing and Moscow move to shape the global information environment both independently and jointly through a wide range of digital tools, they have established several diplomatic channels and forums through which they can exchange best practices,” said Kristine Lee, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security who researches disinformation from China and Russia. “I’d anticipate, as we have seen in recent months, that their mutual learning around these tools will migrate to increasingly cutting-edge capabilities that are difficult to detect but yield maximal payoff in eroding American influence and democratic institutions globally,” she added. ‘There Is No National Lockdown’The amplification of the fake lockdown messages was a notable instance of China’s use of covert disinformation messaging, American officials said. A couple of versions of the message circulated widely, according to The Times analysis. The first instance tracked by The Times appeared on March 13, as many state officials were enacting social distancing policies. This version said Mr. Trump was about to invoke the Stafford Act to shut down the country. The messages generally attributed their contents to a friend in a federal agency — the Pentagon, the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the F.B.I., the C.I.A. and so on. Over days, hundreds of identical posts appeared on Facebook and the online message board 4chan, among other places, and spread through texts. Another version appeared on March 15, The Times found. This one said Mr. Trump was about to deploy the National Guard, military units and emergency responders across the United States while imposing a one-week nationwide quarantine. That same day, the National Security Council announced on Twitter that the messages were fake.“There is no national lockdown,” it said, adding that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “has and will continue to post the latest guidance.” Samantha Vinograd, who was on the National Security Council staff on loan from the Treasury Department during the Obama administration, replied to the council’s tweet, recounting her experience with the disinformation. “I received several texts from loved ones about content they received containing various rumors — they were explicitly asked to share it with their networks,” she wrote. “I advised them to do the opposite. Misinfo is not what we need right now — from any source foreign or domestic.” Since January, Americans have shared many other messages that included disinformation: that the virus originated in a U.S. Army laboratory at Fort Detrick in Maryland, that it can be killed with garlic water, vitamin C or colloidal silver, that it thrives on ibuprofen. Often the posts are attributed to an unnamed source in the U.S. government or an institution such as Johns Hopkins University or Stanford University. As the messages have sown confusion, it has been difficult to trace their true origins or pin down all the ways in which they have been amplified.Ben Decker contributed reporting from Boston.

Protecting Workers From Coronavirus: OSHA Leaves It to Employers,"Adam Ryan, a Target employee in Christiansburg, Va., has felt unsafe at work in recent weeks. He finds it difficult to follow the recommendation that he stay six feet away from others because the store is often crowded and customers linger closely while he restocks shelves. “People will get mad at me when I’m in the area and they want to grab something,” he said. “They just act like it’s business as usual.” Target has taken steps to address workers’ safety concerns, including providing masks, but Mr. Ryan feels that the company hasn’t gone far enough. There is little outside pressure on employers to address concerns like Mr. Ryan’s. That’s partly because the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, known as OSHA, has so far played a low-profile role in the coronavirus crisis. The agency, part of the Labor Department, announced last week that there would be few inspections of workplaces aside from those in high-risk activities like health care and emergency response. Instead, it called on employers to investigate coronavirus-related issues on their own, even in hot spots such as the food supply chain. “I wish they were more involved,” John Henshaw, who led the agency during the George W. Bush administration, said of OSHA’s role. “Certainly meatpacking — I don’t understand why they wouldn’t emphasize it.” At the same time, OSHA has provided few of the incentives, like new workplace rules dealing specifically with infectious disease, that typically prompt employers to address hazards. Last week, in guidelines for “Opening Up America Again,” the White House listed “Protect the health and safety of workers in critical industries” as a core responsibility of the states, even though this is one of OSHA’s key missions. “Most states have NO ability to do this,” David Michaels, who led the agency during the Obama administration, wrote in an email. Dr. Michaels said in an interview that OSHA might understandably focus inspections on certain high-risk industries during a crisis that is straining its resources. But he said this made it even more important for the agency to tell employers how to keep workers safe and clarify their responsibilities for doing so. Instead, “they’re doing the opposite,” he said. “It’s really disheartening.”A Labor Department spokeswoman said that notwithstanding the new enforcement approach, “if OSHA were to find flagrant violations of the law, the agency would use all enforcement tools available.” The spokeswoman said that OSHA had received about 2,400 coronavirus-related complaints by Tuesday and that it had resolved about 1,400. She said that the agency had yet to issue a citation to an employer but that it had six months to complete its investigations. Mr. Ryan, the Target employee in Virginia, has not filed a complaint with OSHA about his concerns. Target cited a policy of limiting the number of shoppers when necessary. It said that it invited workers to raise concerns and had a process in place for addressing them, but that workers had not typically complained about the difficulty of social distancing at that location. Some workplace-safety experts expressed concern that OSHA had largely exempted Covid-19 cases from a general requirement that employers determine whether a worker became seriously ill on the job, and that they report such cases to the agency and keep records of them. In guidance issued on April 10, the agency said it would not enforce the record-keeping requirement for Covid cases until further notice, except when the employer could obtain clear evidence that the infection was work related, a substantially higher bar than before. Only employers in health care, emergency response or prisons must apply the standard record-keeping procedure in Covid cases. The government relies on such reporting in several ways, like deciding which industries and workplaces to inspect in the future. Record-keeping also allows employers to figure out where their problems are and how to address them, making it particularly important when the agency is directing most employers to investigate coronavirus outbreaks on their own, experts said. “First and foremost, they’re supposed to record so they themselves have the information necessary to determine where there are problems and when to do something about them,” said Jordan Barab, a top OSHA appointee during the Obama administration. The Labor Department said in a statement that the pause in enforcing its record-keeping requirement was to “help employers focus their response efforts on implementing good hygiene practices in their workplaces and otherwise mitigating Covid-19’s effects.” Former OSHA officials also note that the agency has not issued a so-called emergency temporary standard that would instruct employers across a variety of industries to put safety protocols into effect and raise the prospect of fines for failing to do so. Such standards can govern physical setups, like whether to install barriers between workstations; workplace rules, like restrictions on the number of customers inside a store; and the use of protective equipment. A standard could even require stores to temporarily bar customers and switch to pickup and delivery only, though such a move would probably invite litigation. The Labor Department spokeswoman said, “OSHA’s current guidances, standards and regulations fully outline the rights and protections of workers from dangers such as the coronavirus.” She pointed to guidance that the agency recently published for several industries, including retail, airlines and waste management. But such guidance tends to be highly discretionary — for example, telling retail employers to “consider restricting the number of customers allowed inside the facility” and to “consider providing alcohol-based hand sanitizers.” The guidance list also neglects some key industries, like meatpacking, that OSHA sometimes struggled to regulate even before the crisis. That has left a vacuum of oversight in workplaces where the virus is taking a toll, former OSHA officials said. Numerous retail workers have died of Covid-19, including employees at a Trader Joe’s in New York State, a Walmart near Chicago and a Whole Foods in Massachusetts, though it is unclear where they were exposed to the virus. Hundreds of workers at a meatpacking plant in South Dakota have been infected, and at least one has died. A worker at a poultry processing plant in Delaware who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation said it was typically impossible for him to maintain six feet between himself and other workers. His job is to pick fallen poultry parts from the floor, clean them and place them back on the line, a task requiring him to circulate between two parallel lines of workers that can be less than six feet apart. The worker said that the plant had erected barriers between workers on some of its lines, but that the hallways were typically crowded during shift changes. Workers at grocery stores described varying approaches to protective equipment, spacing and foot traffic. Marian Meszaros, who works in the meat department of a Best Market on Long Island, said that her store tried to limit the number of shoppers, but that it felt no less crowded than it did before the pandemic. “The customers are still on top of us,” Ms. Meszaros said. “They all huddle around the meat case.”A Best Market spokesman said that “store management actively monitors crowd levels throughout the day and limits customers at busy times,” and that it had placed stickers, markers and signs throughout the store to encourage social distancing. Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the chamber’s health and labor committee, complained about the lack of a standard. “In one grocery store, they are limiting the number of people going in, they’ve got plastic up as protection for workers,” she said. “In another one, they’re jammed in the aisles.” Ms. Murray said she and other Democratic senators had sought language requiring an OSHA emergency standard in coronavirus legislation last month but could not overcome Republican opposition. One difficulty in issuing a workplace standard is the cumbersome federal rule-making process built up over decades. But Ann Rosenthal, who recently retired as the Labor Department’s top OSHA lawyer after serving administrations of both parties, said Congress could suspend the typical rule-making process for OSHA to expedite a new standard on infectious diseases. In the meantime, experts said, the agency could take other steps. Mr. Henshaw, the OSHA leader under Mr. Bush, said he was sympathetic to the idea of relaxing record-keeping requirements but would like to see more specific guidance on how employers could minimize infections — in essence, “We’ll give you a break here, but you have to do this.” He acknowledged, however, that guidance was not mandatory. Ms. Rosenthal said OSHA could issue guidance interpreting existing standards governing sanitation and protective equipment for the coronavirus era, which could effectively require more frequent breaks for hand-washing, as well as enough soap and water. Through the agency’s combination of policy rollbacks and inaction, she said, “they’re sending signals to employers that they don’t have to do anything.”"
"Jay Inslee Endorses Biden, Citing Private Conversations on Climate Policy","Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State, one of the Democratic Party’s most prominent environmentalists, endorsed Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president on Wednesday after extensive private conversations in which Mr. Biden signaled he would make fighting climate change a central cause of his administration. Mr. Inslee, who mounted a long-shot presidential campaign of his own last year, said in an interview that he had spoken repeatedly to Mr. Biden in recent weeks and came away convinced that the former vice president was preparing to greatly expand his policy proposals for reducing carbon emissions and promoting renewable energy. Though he and Mr. Biden clashed early in the primary season, Mr. Inslee said he was confident that Mr. Biden was “willing to aim faster and higher” on climate policy than he had indicated at that stage. Mr. Inslee said his aides were consulting with Mr. Biden’s campaign about new components to his environmental agenda. “I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that this will be a major driving force of his administration,” Mr. Inslee said. “I think what you’re going to see is an increased commitment to some shorter-term actions and he’s been very open to that.” Mr. Inslee’s endorsement comes as little surprise, given Mr. Biden’s status as the presumptive Democratic nominee. The Biden campaign has rolled out a series of valuable endorsements over the past few weeks, a phase of the campaign in which public activity has been strictly limited by the coronavirus outbreak. Last week, endorsement videos from former President Barack Obama and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren helped Mr. Biden stir Democratic enthusiasm and raise money during a news cycle overwhelmed by the pandemic. Mr. Inslee has been among the most prominent governors confronting the crisis, ordering early lockdowns and other restrictions that have helped limit the damage in Washington State to a fraction of the ruin inflicted on New York, where public officials acted somewhat more slowly. The emergency has also brought Mr. Inslee into conflict with President Trump, whom Mr. Inslee has criticized for his handling of the outbreak. Mr. Trump has answered Mr. Inslee’s criticism with heated personal and partisan attacks, calling him a “snake.” But unlike some governors who have tried to mute their differences with Mr. Trump while they are lobbying his administration for help in the fight against coronavirus, Mr. Inslee made plain in the interview that he intended to speak bluntly about what he saw as Mr. Trump’s deficiencies. He said the president had shown “no empathy for anyone but himself” and had “abused even Republican governors” who expressed dissatisfaction with the federal government’s performance. “I’ve had to deal with a totally dishonest person in the White House,” Mr. Inslee said, predicting that Mr. Biden would be a better partner for governors in both parties. In addition to the endorsement, Mr. Inslee participated in another ritual of Mr. Biden’s lockdown-era campaign: On Tuesday, he recorded an episode for Mr. Biden’s podcast, “Here’s the Deal,” which has previously featured conversations with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan. On the podcast, Mr. Biden alluded to numerous private conversations about climate with Mr. Inslee, as well as with former Vice President Al Gore; in his view, Mr. Biden said, confronting the climate crisis represented an enormous opportunity for the United States to create jobs “generating a fundamentally green infrastructure.” Mr. Inslee’s vote of confidence in Mr. Biden comes at a timely moment, on the 50th occasion of Earth Day and as the former vice president continues to face grumbling on the left about the scope of his announced climate policies. While Mr. Biden has embraced a broad agenda to limit emissions, progressives have long viewed his stated timeline — reducing emissions to net zero by 2050 — as dangerously slow. During one of the debates last year, Mr. Inslee was among those who challenged Mr. Biden’s plans as “too little, too late.” But Mr. Biden has shown signs recently of raising his governing ambitions across the board, not only on climate, even adopting some of the messages of former rivals like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren in arguing that the next president will have to seek much larger social and economic change to help the country recover from the current crisis. Mr. Inslee, who is seeking a third term as governor this November, expressed little sympathy for reluctant liberals, urging them to get on board with Mr. Biden as quickly as possible. Whatever their preferences during primary season, Mr. Inslee said, Democrats should recognize that Mr. Biden’s candidacy represents “a chance for the survival of life as we know it.” “The faster we get in harness together, the likelier it is we will remove a man who has dedicated himself to deceit and rejection of science,” he said. Mr. Inslee allowed that some of his enthusiasm for Mr. Biden stemmed from factors besides policy, describing the former vice president as open-minded and easy to connect with — common sentiments among Mr. Biden’s former rivals who have aligned themselves with unusual speed behind a candidate who not long ago seemed to be on the brink of defeat. “I just enjoy talking to Joe Biden,” Mr. Inslee said. “Maybe that’s one of the reasons he’s been successful as a leader.”"
"Is Biden Gaining Older Voters, and Losing Young Ones?","After impeachment, a coronavirus pandemic and four years of tweets, the early national polls show that the 2020 presidential campaign begins almost exactly where it left off in 2016. Today, Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by just under six percentage points among registered voters. Nearly four years ago, the final national polls showed that Hillary Clinton led Mr. Trump by around five percentage points among registered voters. The similarities are even starker on closer examination. The polls depict an electorate that remains split in the same ways, with Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden drawing nearly identical numbers to ones the candidates did four years ago among white voters with or without a college degree. But not everything is exactly the same, and even modest differences have the potential to alter the race. Mr. Biden shows early strength among older voters; Mr. Trump has made gains among nonwhite voters. There are early signs of an expanded gender gap. All of this could change by November, but all of it could be decisive in a contest with the potential to be closely fought. Here’s how the coalitions have or haven’t changed in the last four years.What’s the sameTrump trails by 5 or 6 pointsIn the compilation of high-quality, methodologically comparable live-interview telephone surveys used for this analysis, Mrs. Clinton led by exactly five points among registered voters in polls conducted after the third presidential debate in October 2016. Mr. Biden, in contrast, leads in methodologically similar polls by 5.8 points. Of course, state polls struggled in 2016. But the national polls weren’t so bad. The national polls used here showed Mrs. Clinton ahead by 3.7 points among likely voters, or only about 1.6 points more than her final 2.1-point popular vote margin. It’s worth recalling that a 1.6-point shift in Mrs. Clinton’s favor would have probably won her the election, and Mr. Biden will probably be considered a modest if narrow favorite if he enters the election with a five-point lead among registered voters. A huge split among white voters by college educationThe defining feature of the 2016 presidential election was a huge gap between the preferences of white voters with or without a college degree. Four years later, this wide split remains essentially unchanged, with Mr. Trump leading by around 30 points among whites without a college degree and Mr. Biden holding a double-digit lead among whites with a college degree. It suggests that Mr. Biden, despite his reputed appeal to white working-class voters, has not succeeded in broadly winning back those in that group who flipped from President Obama in 2012 to Mr. Trump in 2016. It also suggests that Mr. Biden has not made huge gains among college-educated white voters, as some assume based on Democratic gains in suburban areas. Exit polls in 2016, often used for electoral analysis, showed that Mr. Trump won college-educated white voters. But the exit polls were severely biased on this measure. It seems far likelier that Mrs. Clinton won them. In recent off-year races, Democrats might have won in suburban areas because of a turnout advantage or by persuading traditionally Republican-leaning voters who had already supported Mrs. Clinton to back Democrats down-ballot — not necessarily because they flipped many more college-educated white voters. A relative Trump advantage in the Electoral CollegeMr. Trump’s wide lead among white voters without a college degree means that he has retained his advantage in the relatively white working-class battleground states that have tended to decide recent American presidential elections. So far, state polls show that Mr. Biden holds only a narrow lead — perhaps around a combined average of two points — among registered voters in the states likeliest to decide the presidency: Florida, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Arizona. It’s consistent with the data from the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats won the U.S. House vote in Wisconsin and Arizona narrowly — and lost it in Florida — despite winning the national vote by seven points. It’s also consistent with the major 2018 election surveys, which found Mr. Trump’s approval rating about even in the same states. Mr. Trump’s persistent relative advantage in the Electoral College gives Republicans a chance to win the presidency without the popular vote for the third time in six elections. What’s different, so farA Biden surge among the oldest votersThe similarities between the 2016 and 2020 polls are stark, but there are notable differences, too. One is that Mr. Biden holds a wide lead among voters 65 and older, upsetting for now a nearly two-decade pattern of Republican strength among the oldest voters. Over all, Mr. Biden holds nearly a 10-point lead among registered voters in this age group, while Mrs. Clinton trailed among these voters by five points in the final polls. This is not a small shift. It is consistent across every live-interview poll; it is not easy to explain; and it is fairly new. As recently as the 2018 midterm elections, the president’s approval rating among seniors was above water, and Republicans won the group. Part of the difference is compositional: Baby boomers now make up nearly 60 percent of registered voters over 65, up from 40 percent in 2016. As a result, Mrs. Clinton was probably fairly competitive among the group of voters who are 65 and over today, even though four years ago she lost those who were 65 and over. Compositional shifts might explain even more than this, if it turns out that the greater mortality rate of older men compared with women means that Mr. Trump’s older supporters have departed the electorate at a higher rate. But it seems unlikely that compositional change explains it all. Another factor is a growing bias in polling: Young women respond at a low rate to telephone surveys on cellphones. Pollsters typically adjust their samples to ensure a representative number of women or younger voters over all, but only a few do so in a way that ensures they have the right number of younger or older women. As a result, most pollsters give more weight to women over all, yielding a sample with the right number of women in total but still too few younger ones and, as a consequence, too many older women. Without any special adjustment, women might represent 60 percent or more of voters over age 65 in a typical high-quality national poll, compared with about 55 percent in reality. This probably expands Mr. Biden’s lead among seniors by about two percentage points — not enough to explain the whole shift but a component. Together, the polling and compositional explanations might cover nearly half of the shift toward Mr. Biden. What explains the rest? One possible explanation is Mr. Biden himself. Older voters appear to have a favorable view of him, and it’s not hard to imagine why they might see him in a more favorable light than Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton or even John Kerry. He is the first white male Democratic nominee since 2004, and he is probably the first one since 2000 or perhaps earlier who won’t easily be dismissed as a liberal. He is not campaigning on the kind of culture war issues, like immigration, racial justice or gay marriage, that have tended to work to conservatives’ advantage with this group for decades. In other words, older voters may like him for many of the same reasons he disappoints young progressives. Another possible explanation is Mr. Trump — and perhaps especially his coronavirus response. Older people are relatively vulnerable to the coronavirus and relatively insulated from the effects of an economic shutdown. The president’s drive to reopen the economy, and questions about his slow response, may resonate very differently for a retiree who backed Mr. Trump than for a young parent struggling to support children. A recent Morning Consult poll found that Mr. Trump’s approval rating on the coronavirus response was lower among seniors than among any other group. Whatever the explanation, Mr. Biden’s newfound strength among older voters could be a great asset. They represent an above-average share of the electorate in many top battlegrounds, including Florida. They turn out at high numbers, potentially denting the traditional Republican advantage among likely voters. But it remains to be seen whether Mr. Biden’s strength here will prove durable. Mr. Trump could peel back these losses by refocusing on the cultural issues that have long cemented Republican strength among this group. Trump gains among nonwhite votersMr. Trump, on the other hand, has made gains among nonwhite voters, one of his weaknesses. In recent polls, he holds the support of 22 percent of nonwhite registered voters, a higher level for him than in any of the late live-interview polls in 2016. It is hard to break this down further, since many pollsters do not disaggregate nonwhite voters by race, but there are signs that he is overperforming among both black and Hispanic voters and perhaps especially among young nonwhite voters. The explanation for Mr. Trump’s improvement among this group isn’t necessarily obvious either, but the evidence for it stretches back much further. Nonwhite voters were conspicuously absent from the “resistance” surge in Democratic turnout during Trump-era special and general elections. National polls have long shown that the president’s approval rating was relatively solid, or perhaps even up slightly compared with his 2016 showing, among nonwhite voters, even when his approval rating was far weaker than it is today. . As with Mr. Biden’s strength among older voters, it’s hard to know whether Mr. Trump’s improvement among nonwhite voters will prove sustainable over the longer run. Either way, it may argue against a surge in nonwhite turnout. Nonwhite voters are usually less likely to vote if they don’t back a Democratic candidate, and even if some wind up returning to Mr. Biden, it seems to suggest they won’t feel any great imperative to turn out and oust the president if they feel comfortable backing him today. What’s probably differentBiden weakness among younger votersThere are signs that Mr. Biden is performing worse among younger voters than Mrs. Clinton did four years ago, but this is not entirely clear. Pollsters are somewhat inconsistent about how they divvy up voters under 65, making it hard to compile a clear picture of one particular age group. And many age groupings of registered voters are smaller than the 65-and-over group, making the results less precise. All of this is muddled even further by compositional changes, with the Republican-friendly group of Reagan-era Gen-Xers aging into the 50-to-64-year-old category, or the more Democratic-friendly baby boomers aging out of it. The data is reported most consistently on voters under 35, and over all Mr. Biden appears to fare a few points worse among 18-to-34-year-olds than Mrs. Clinton did. This is a small enough margin that it would be hard to be sure of a change under any circumstances, but the possible biases in the gender composition of young voters in public polls add to the uncertainty. In some polls, men represent 60 percent or more of young voters, even though they represent only 49 percent of young registered voters. This might suppress Mr. Biden’s margin among younger voters by three or four points. It might cover much of the apparent gap with Mrs. Clinton, even as the same theory does not explain Mr. Biden’s strength among older voters in full. In general, it seems somewhat likely that Mr. Biden is doing worse than Mrs. Clinton among voters under 65, given that he’s doing about the same as her over all while doing much better among those 65 and up. But it’s hard to say with confidence, and even harder to say exactly where Mr. Biden is weak or to what extent. It’s possible that Mr. Biden is faring, say, only two percentage points worse across most age groups under 65; it’s also possible he has a narrower and more pronounced weakness among voters under 29. It’s not clear yet. A wider gender gapThere was a wide gender gap in the 2016 election. So far, polls show it’s even bigger than four years ago, with Mr. Biden leading by a wider margin among women while Mr. Trump has a wider edge among men. The shifts are not so large or consistent from poll to poll to know that it’s a sure thing. The shifts are also modest enough that it’s not obvious whether gender or another demographic is driving it. For instance, women make up a larger share among the over-65 group than among younger voters, so Mr. Biden’s strength among older voters may be expanding the gender gap, or it could be that his strength among female voters is helping expand his edge among older voters. Fewer undecided and minor-party votersIn polls four years ago, a relatively large number of voters said they were undecided or backed minor-party candidates like Jill Stein and Gary Johnson. So far, there’s nothing like it in national polls. Of course, most national polls aren’t naming third-party candidates. It’s possible that a named Libertarian or Green Party candidate will ultimately win a modest share of support in pre-election polls. But it seems unlikely given the higher favorability ratings of the two major candidates, and it’s even possible that minor-party candidates will struggle to get on the ballot because of the coronavirus. And given the tendency for support among minor-party candidates to dwindle over the course of a campaign, even a modest number of minor-party voters now would not necessarily suggest a similar size vote in November."
"Trump Halts New Green Cards, but Backs Off Broader Immigration Ban","WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Tuesday that he would order a temporary halt in issuing green cards to prevent people from immigrating to the United States, but he backed away from plans to suspend guest worker programs after business groups exploded in anger at the threat of losing access to foreign labor. Mr. Trump, whose administration has faced intense criticism in recent months for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, abruptly sought to change the subject Tuesday night by resuming his assault on immigration, which animated his 2016 campaign and became one of the defining issues of his presidency. He cast his decision to “suspend immigration,” which he first announced on Twitter Monday night, as a move to protect American jobs. But it comes as the United States economy sheds its work force at a record rate and when few employers are reaching out for workers at home or abroad. More than 22 million Americans have lost their jobs in the economic devastation caused by the virus and efforts to contain it. Mr. Trump said that his order would initially be in effect for 60 days, but that he might extend it “based on economic conditions at the time.” “We can do that at a little bit different time if we want,” he said of a second executive order that could further restrict immigration. While numerous studies have concluded that immigration has an overall positive effect on the American work force and wages for workers, Mr. Trump ignored that research on Tuesday, insisting that American citizens who had lost their jobs in recent weeks should not have to compete with foreigners when the economy reopens. “By pausing immigration, we will help put unemployed Americans first in line for jobs as America reopens. So important,” the president said. “It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad. We must first take care of the American worker.” Lawyers at the Justice Department were still studying whether the president had the legal authority to unilaterally suspend the issuance of green cards, an order that caught officials at the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security off guard, according to people with knowledge of the announcement. The decision not to block guest worker programs — which provide specific visas for technology workers, farm laborers and others — is a concession to business groups, which assailed the White House on Tuesday. Jason Oxman, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group, said in a statement earlier in the day that “the United States will not benefit from shutting down legal immigration.” Rob Larew, the president of the National Farmers Union, said even talk of restrictions on immigrant farm workers was disruptive. “It just adds to an already stressed food system,” he said. “If we do not have enough workers at the front end of that, it just adds more challenges to folks that need to get the food,” he added. As late as Monday night, after Mr. Trump’s tweet, top White House officials said they believed the president’s order would apply to some of the guest worker programs, while exempting others. By Tuesday afternoon — amid the business backlash — officials acknowledged that devising an order that applied to some guest workers but not others would be overly complicated, and they abandoned it. Mr. Trump said that his “pause” in immigration “will not apply to those entering on a temporary basis,” a reference to the worker visas, though he hinted that could change. “We want to protect our U.S. workers,” he said, “and I think as we move forward, we will become more and more protective of them.” The decision to maintain most temporary work visas is certain to please business executives, but it will disappoint anti-immigrant groups, which have long called on the president to put an end to the guest worker programs they view as robbing Americans of jobs. And it could undermine Mr. Trump’s message to voters, many of whom are angry about competition from the foreign workers brought into the United States through those programs. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has used health concerns to justify aggressively restricting immigration. Even before Tuesday’s announcement, the administration had expanded travel restrictions, slowed visa processing and moved to swiftly return to their home countries asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants who cross the border, alarming immigration advocates who have said that Mr. Trump and his advisers are using the pandemic to further hard-line immigration policies. The president’s new executive order, which he could sign as early as Wednesday, will further close off the United States to tens of thousands of people seeking to live and work in the country, a move intended in part to stoke populist anger among his core supporters as he heads toward Election Day in November. Last year, about one million people were granted legal permanent resident status, commonly referred to as a green card. Officials said on Tuesday that American citizens seeking to bring their children or spouses to the United States would still be allowed to do so. But the path to living and working in the country legally would be blocked for other foreigners, including the relatives of current green card holders and those seeking green cards based on a job offer. An analysis by the Migration Policy Institute estimates that the policy could affect as many as 660,000 people. The announcement on green cards elicited a fierce reaction from immigration rights advocates, who accused Mr. Trump and Stephen Miller, the architect of the president’s immigration agenda, of using the grim economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic as a justification for a broad assault on the nation’s legal immigration system. “No one is losing their job because of competition from immigrants; they’re losing their job because no one can leave their house,” said Doug Rand, who worked on immigration in the Obama administration and helped found a technology company in Seattle that helps immigrants obtain green cards and citizenship. He said the president’s advisers were using the pandemic to cut back on immigration the way they had always wanted to. Others called the president’s announcement misguided and accused Mr. Trump of being motivated by an ugly, anti-immigrant sentiment. “This is both a political act to demagogue and distract from his awful handling of the Covid-19 crisis and lack of testing,” said Todd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, a technology group that advocates immigration, “and it is also a policy effort by hard-liners to use this crisis to enact their awful, decades-old wish list to radically slash immigration.” The president’s re-election campaign on Tuesday sent an email to his supporters underscoring the political importance of the issue for Mr. Trump, who successfully used anti-immigrant talk as a weapon in the 2016 campaign and made attempts to sharply reduce immigration one of the defining issues of his time in the White House. “Pres. Trump will sign an Executive Order to suspend immigration,” read a text message to supporters. “Do you support his decision to protect us from the Coronavirus? Take Survey NOW.” Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the president’s 2020 campaign, said in a statement that “at a time when our economy has been artificially interrupted by the virus, introducing more competition for jobs would worsen unemployment and depress wages, especially in black and Latino communities.” Anti-immigration activists said they were hopeful that the president’s executive order would make good on the sweeping promise from Monday night’s tweet to suspend immigration into the United States. Roy H. Beck, the founder of NumbersUSA, a group that presses for deep cuts in legal immigration, said that such a message would be a potent political tool as Mr. Trump faces off against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the election. “Absolutely it’s powerful,” Mr. Beck said. “If he comes out with an executive order that honors that tweet, he really is telling voters, I get it. When you have job loss, you can’t have immigration. That is the populist message that I think was his strongest suit in 2016.” It was unclear what legal authority the president will claim to shut off the decades-old immigration system, even temporarily. In the past, he has cited health emergency powers to restrict asylum at the southwestern border, and the White House has repeatedly invoked broad executive powers in immigration law to impose travel bans. A Homeland Security Department official said early Tuesday that the executive order was still being drafted — leaving some top agency officials in the dark — and that details of the potential ban, including on specific exemptions, were subject to change. Officials said the effort was being coordinated by Mr. Miller and a handful of his allies, including Robert Law, the chief of policy and strategy for Citizenship and Immigration Services. Some military officials also seemed to be caught by surprise on Tuesday by Mr. Trump’s late-night Twitter message. Gen. Terrence J. O’Shaughnessy, the head of the military’s Northern Command, which supports homeland defense and border security, said on Tuesday that he had not received any new orders to assist border operations. Even before the president’s announcement Tuesday evening, officials were working on the assumption that visas for guest workers, including farm laborers, would be exempt from the executive order, according to an official. Hours before Mr. Trump tweeted the announcement, the administration published a final rule that eased requirements for employers like farmers that use the H-2A program by lifting a three-year limit for such seasonal workers. The State Department suspended visa services last month at U.S. embassies and consulates, but immigrants were still able to take procedural steps to come to the United States. Those already in the country were also still able to petition for their relatives abroad to come to the United States in the hopes of reuniting with their families. While the Trump administration has already paralyzed multiple aspects of the immigration system, including halting in-person interviews and naturalization ceremonies, immigration experts and administration officials said an executive order could have longstanding consequences. “Their first impulse when you’re confronted with a crisis is to shut down immigration,” Jeh Johnson, a homeland security secretary under President Barack Obama, said on Tuesday during an online panel hosted by the House Homeland Security Committee. “The first impulse and the last impulse,” he said, “can’t always just be stop immigration to prevent a public health disaster that is already here within our borders.”Michael D.

Coronavirus Takes Over Political Advertising,"Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.For much of the past six weeks, political campaigns were reluctant to focus too heavily on the coronavirus outbreak. Though some outside groups started to criticize President Trump’s handling of the crisis, the virus was largely considered off-limits to many campaigns, which worried about politicizing the unending tragedy. That, however, has changed.Now, more than 50 percent of all political ads on TV are about the coronavirus, the first time that a majority of ads were focused on the outbreak, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. There were 33 unique ads centering on the virus that aired last week, spanning the presidential, Senate and congressional elections. Of course, some groups have been advertising about the pandemic for weeks. But five weeks ago, as states like New York, New Jersey and California shuttered schools and announced stay-at-home orders, less than 2 percent of ads touched on the coronavirus. Now, 54 percent are about the coronavirus. For Democratic candidates and liberal-leaning groups, one issue has dominated recent ads: the lack of personal protective equipment — commonly referred to as P.P.E. — for front-line medical workers. Those ads have characterized the shortage as a failure of the Trump administration. Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC, spent roughly $380,000 last week on an ad that spliced Mr. Trump’s past statements dismissing the need for more personal protective equipment with pleas from medical professionals begging for masks, gowns and other supplies. The ad, which aired in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, is part of a $7.6 million campaign by the group to “continue to air the facts and the truth and hold the president accountable,” as Guy Cecil, the chairman of the group, said when the ads were released. Priorities USA has also pledged $65 million in initial buys through November. Majority Forward, one of the leading outside Democratic groups focused on the battle for the Maine Senate race, spent $150,000 last week on ads highlighting equipment shortages in the state’s hospitals, with a narrator referring to Maine’s Republican senator and lamenting that “once again, Susan Collins defends the president.” Republicans are also fighting to claim the mantle of protecting health care workers. In North Carolina, a group called the Taxpayers Protection Alliance began airing an ad supporting Senator Thom Tillis that thanks him for “caring for the doctors that care for us.” In Montana, an ad from Senator Steve Daines boasts of “funding protective medical gear for our health care heroes.” And Ms. Collins, who has aired six different ads on the coronavirus, has one ad dedicated entirely to thanking the “real heroes of the coronavirus crisis,” which makes absolutely no mention of her campaign or political efforts. Larry McCarthy, a Republican ad maker who is running the ad campaign for Ms. Collins, said that the lag in coronavirus-related advertising could partly be attributed to simple production times. “Usually, the ads that viewers are seeing this week on their TV sets were made a week or two or four weeks ago,” Mr. McCarthy said. “Now, because of all the stay-at-home restrictions, you’re seeing ads shot on iPhones and Zoom and everything else because you really can’t go out and take a big crew around a given state.” Ms. Collins’s Democratic opponent in Maine, Sara Gideon, is airing a 60-second ad that features highlights from a recent forum, conducted over Zoom. The grainy desktop camera resolution and awkward angles have come to define so many meetings happening these days. While many campaigns have focused on the front-line workers, the groups working to re-elect Mr. Trump have a different focus: Joe Biden. The Trump-aligned super PAC America First Action made its first foray into the election this month by announcing a $10 million buy, and spent just under $350,000 on two ads that seek to paint the former vice president’s past statements on China as problematic, with shaky allusions to the virus’s origins. There is, however, a brief defense of Mr. Trump in one ad, praising his decision to close travel from China in January, when a narrator proclaims, “President Trump took action.” Two seconds later, however, the ad’s focus returns to Mr. Biden. Drop us a line! We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We’ll try to answer it. Have a comment? We’re all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com.  Ad of the week: One photo, 30-seconds It’s a relatively candid shot of Senator Mitch McConnell, a black-and-white image of the Republican majority leader emerging from behind a door, likely somewhere amid the Capitol complex. For 30 seconds, it is the only image the viewer sees. A very slow zoom crawls forward, as dramatic, ominous music tracks a narrator in the background. With many Democrats focusing their criticism squarely on the White House, Mr. McConnell is also up for re-election. And his Democratic opponent, Amy McGrath, is attacking the majority leader for the federal government’s response to the pandemic. The message: Being majority leader is an immensely powerful position, and Ms. McGrath is making the argument that Mr. McConnell has squandered his power in response to the coronavirus outbreak. As a narrator infers that Mr. McConnell is taking a “victory lap” on the response to the outbreak, the estimated death tolls and job losses scroll across the bottom of the screen. The takeaway: The single photo and black-and-white tone evoke an aura of the Washington “back room deal” and infer that it wasn’t one made with the goal of combating the coronavirus. And in a media environment where continually scrolling doomsday headlines flash across the screen in a constant loop, pausing to focus on just a single picture could actually break through.

Trump and Cuomo Put Aside Disputes During White House Meeting,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, two New Yorkers who have alternately praised and quarreled with each other during the coronavirus pandemic that has ravaged their mutual home state, met in person on Tuesday to try to resolve differences over testing and financial relief. After weeks of talking by telephone and through the news media, Mr. Cuomo traveled to Washington to sit down with the president at the White House and press for more federal assistance to expand testing for the virus and to help financially devastated state and local governments. Mr. Cuomo afterward called it “a very good conversation,” playing down the sporadic disputes between the two men. “The president is communicative about his feelings, and I’m communicative about what I think,” Mr. Cuomo said on MSNBC. “But look, I think for the president and for myself, this is not about — this is not about anyone’s emotions, about anyone else. I mean, who cares, right? What I feel, what he feels. We have a tremendous job that we have to get done and put everything else aside and do the job. And that was the tone of the conversation, was very functional and effective.” Speaking at an evening news conference in the State Capitol in Albany, Mr. Cuomo said the meeting largely focused on ramping up diagnostic testing in New York. “Testing is a very complicated issue with a lot of levels,” he said, adding that he discussed division of labor between federal government and state. “That’s what we did this afternoon.” In particular, Mr. Cuomo said that the state needed help in unknotting a supply chain from large manufacturers to some 300 smaller laboratories in New York. The state, he said, “can’t do international supply chains,” and he added that he wanted to “let the federal government take responsibility for that federal supply chain.” Mr. Cuomo said that he secured a commitment from the president to try to increase the number of tests in New York for both the coronavirus and the antibodies to 40,000 a day. The federal government will work on increasing the supply of reagents and testing kits from national manufacturers necessary to process the tests, and the state will handle coordination with the laboratories in New York. Mr. Trump did not invite cameras to record the encounter, as he typically does with prominent visitors. But at his daily briefing later in the afternoon, the president said he and the governor were aligned on the issue of testing without elaborating. “We had a great talk on testing,” Mr. Trump said. “We have an agreement, we have an understanding on testing.” He also signaled a willingness to seek aid for states. “I agree with him on that,” he said, “and I think most Republicans agree too, and Democrats.” The president added that he had worked hard to help New York by helping provide medical equipment and new hospital beds and sending the Navy hospital ship Comfort, which is no longer needed and so will return to its home port in Virginia. “The federal government has spared no expense or resource to get New Yorkers the care they need and the care they deserve,” Mr. Trump said. The president and governor of different political parties have variously exchanged compliments and argued long distance over the past six weeks as New York became the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States with more than 250,000 reported cases and about 15,000 deaths. They have been at odds over the provision of equipment like ventilators and over the president’s claim to “absolute” power to overrule governors to reopen businesses, schools and everyday life. “We don’t have a king in this country,” Mr. Cuomo said at one point. But at others, he has said Mr. Trump has “delivered for New York.” After Tuesday’s meeting, Mr. Cuomo said he did not bother to raise some of their past disputes during their time together in the White House. “You can’t rebut everything,” he said, “so sometimes you just let it go in life.”Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Jesse McKinley from Albany."
House Readies Historic Changes to Allow Remote Voting During Pandemic,"WASHINGTON — Democratic leaders plan to move this week to change the rules of the House of Representatives to allow lawmakers to cast votes remotely for the first time in its 231-year history, a major concession to the constraints created by the coronavirus pandemic. Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader, advised lawmakers on Tuesday that they were likely to vote on Thursday on the new rules, which would temporarily allow members to designate another lawmaker to cast votes for them by proxy if they are unable to travel to the Capitol themselves. He framed it as a common-sense decision to help the 430-member body function more smoothly as the virus alters American life and forces millions of people to shelter in place to slow its spread. “We want to be able to do the people’s work, notwithstanding the directions to remain at distance,” Mr. Hoyer told reporters on Tuesday. House Republican leaders said they were opposed to the plan, and urged their members to vote against it. Either way, Democrats have more than enough votes to push through the change themselves. The Republican-controlled Senate, a smaller, clubbier body whose members are even more reluctant to dispatch with tradition, is unlikely to follow suit. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has firmly rejected the idea. On Tuesday afternoon, after the Senate passed a $484 billion coronavirus relief bill by voice vote — the only way to do business since most senators are absent from the capital — Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, tried unsuccessfully to force a change in the rules to allow emergency remote voting. Mr. McConnell blocked the move. The coming changes in the House have been weeks in the making. Many of the chamber’s younger members have been arguing aggressively that remote voting would model good behavior for the country, keep their older colleagues — one-third of the House members are at least 65 — safe and allow for greater continuity in a time of national crisis. But the leaders had been hesitant to discard precedent, particularly when Congress is being called upon to enact sweeping policies to respond to the virus. Under its current rules, the House can pass measures only if no lawmaker objects or if members travel to vote in person, as they are expected to do on Thursday when, in addition to the rules change, the House will consider the $484 billion relief package for small businesses straining under the effects of the pandemic. The proxy voting arrangement is something of a low-tech compromise between competing proposals for how to proceed. Under the current plan, devised by Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Rules Committee, any member of Congress could submit his or her vote to the House in writing. It would then be entered into the record by another lawmaker present in the Capitol, who would not be allowed to change his or her colleague’s vote. Still, many Republicans have chafed at the plan and could oppose Thursday’s vote en masse. Republican leaders indicated they were irked that the Democrats did not bring them further into the planning process, but many of their members said they simply saw no reason for Congress not to show up in person when other essential workers all over the country, including President Trump, are doing so. “We should be here in person to vote,” said Representative Andy Harris, Republican of Maryland. “That’s the way it’s been done for 200 years. That’s the way we should do it now.” Mr. Harris, who can easily drive to the Capitol from his home, was wearing a plastic face shield when he spoke to reporters on Tuesday. Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Rules Committee, said he was “extremely skeptical” that the plan could work. He noted in an interview that Congress continued to meet during the Civil War, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and during the Spanish influenza — and said it should continue to now. “I don’t think this seems remotely workable if you don’t have bipartisan buy-in,” Mr. Cole warned. Democrats seemed ready to contemplate even broader changes. In a separate letter to colleagues on Tuesday, Mr. Hoyer pushed to go further, making the case for voting and convening hearings through videoconferencing technology, like FaceTime or Zoom. “Beyond implementing the proxy voting as a first step, we ought to use this time as an opportunity to prepare for Congress to be able to work according to its full capabilities even with social and physical distancing guidelines in place,” he wrote. Those more ambitious changes could present constitutional, as well as security, challenges that Speaker Nancy Pelosi has tried to avoid. Proposals like Mr. Hoyer’s have also run into a more basic roadblock: Many of the House’s members are older and technologically unsophisticated. For members who struggle on regular caucus conference calls to figure out how to mute and umute their cellphones, voting by FaceTime would be no easy task. House leaders also continue to study how they could effectively move online for the time being committee hearings that constitute much of Congress’s oversight and policy work. Senators, under the direction of Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri and the chairman of the Rules Committee, are considering allowing some committee hearings to be conducted remotely. If they could agree to a plan, Republicans could resume work on one of the hallmarks of their majority: confirming conservative judges to lifetime appointments on the federal bench.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting."
‘I’m Just Living a Nightmare’: Oil Industry Braces for Devastation,"HOUSTON — Workers at Marathon Petroleum’s refinery in Gallup, N.M., are turning off the valves. Oil companies in West Texas are paying early termination fees to contract employees rather than drill new wells. And in Montana, producers are shutting down wells and slashing salaries and benefits. Just a few months ago, the American oil industry was triumphant in its quest for energy independence, having turned the United States into the world’s biggest petroleum producer for the first time in decades. But that exhilaration has given way to despair as the coronavirus has kneecapped the economy, destroying demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel as cars sit parked in driveways and planes are consigned to remote fields and runways. The oil industry has lived through many booms and busts, but never before have prices collapsed as they have this week. On Monday, one closely watched price fell below zero, meaning some traders had to pay others to take crude oil off their hands. That price — for May delivery — recovered on Tuesday, but not nearly to levels where oil companies can make a profit. At the same time, the price of oil for June delivery fell by about half to roughly $10 a barrel. “I’m just living a nightmare,” said Ben Sheppard, president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, which represents companies in the area of Texas and New Mexico that became the world’s most productive oil field last year. In Midland, Texas, the epicenter of the oil shale boom over the last decade, parking lots at companies like Chevron, Diamondback and Apache are empty aside from a scattering of pumping trucks. Executives are working from home, huddling with their colleagues and board members to decide how quickly to shut down production and lay off workers. Oil giants like Exxon Mobil have slashed their 2020 exploration and production budgets by nearly a third, and that was before the total oil price collapse at the start of this week. Many smaller oil companies are expected to seek bankruptcy protection in the coming months after having spent years borrowing billions of dollars to extract and move crude. Production companies have $86 billion in debt coming due between 2020 and 2024, and pipeline companies have an additional $123 billion they have to repay or refinance over the same period, according to Moody’s Investors Service. “We are worried that the current disorderly market has adversely damaged the industry,” said Ben Luckock, co-head of oil trading at Trafigura, a large exporter of American crude. “In the short term some form of government assistance is likely needed because the price levels we are currently transacting at are unsustainable for U.S. producers.” The reverberations to other industries could be significant. A decade or two ago, low oil prices would serve to bolster the American economy by reducing energy costs. But the oil industry has become so big and important — it directly and indirectly employs 10 million people — that its problems will deal a blow to many kinds of businesses, including manufacturers that build its equipment, steel companies that make its pipes and banks and hedge funds that lend it money. President Trump has said that he stands ready to help U.S. oil and gas businesses, a position he reiterated on Tuesday. But the policies he and other administration officials have proposed — imposing tariffs on foreign oil or filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — would do so little that their impact would amount to a rounding error. Simply put, the global oil industry is producing vastly more oil than the world needs — about 30 million barrels a day too much. Even if the federal government started buying oil for the reserve immediately, it could absorb only half a million barrels a day, or less than 2 percent of the excess world production. Some industry executives had pinned their hopes on the Texas Railroad Commission, asking it to exercise a power it has not used since 1973 to force oil companies in the state to cut production. But the commission, which regulates the industry there, declined to do so at a meeting held by videoconference on Tuesday, with two of its three commissioners saying that they needed more legal advice before making a decision. All the while, the glut of oil keeps growing. And refineries, storage tank hubs and pipelines are quickly filling to the brim, while ocean tankers carrying as much as 300 million barrels of oil are floating or sailing figure-eights waiting for buyers. The tanker operators, who can make more than $100,000 a day for spot charters of their ships, may be the only ones making money right now. Mr. Trump’s biggest service to the industry was to help push Saudi Arabia, Russia and other producers to reach a deal on April 12 to cut 9.7 million barrels of daily oil output. But oil prices fell sharply after that agreement as traders realized its inadequacy. It also doesn’t help that the pact won’t even go into effect until May 1. With 73 employees, Texland Petroleum, a producer in the Permian Basin that has 1,211 wells, is typical of hundreds of independent companies that represent the backbone of the industry, especially in rural areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and North Dakota. In business since 1973, it has survived several downturns but always managed to sell its oil at prices that allowed it to at least break even. That is not true anymore. At least four customers have canceled purchases in recent days. One customer canceled contracts effective May 1 for 2,000 barrels a day, nearly 30 percent of the company’s output. “It’s a sad time for our business, that’s for damn sure,” said Jim Wilkes, president of Texland. “The future is very cloudy right now because the pricing is below our production costs.” Mr. Wilkes has decided to shut all production and end all sales on May 1. Shutting wells is an expensive, laborious process, he explained, with workers obliged to treat well casings with chemicals so they do not corrode once oil stops flowing. And there is no guarantee that a shuttered well can be restarted and be made to pump out as much oil as it did earlier. Mr. Wilkes said he was not planning to fire anyone, at least not now, because he took a Small Business Administration loan to pay his workers for two months, at which point the loan will be forgiven. But he is not sure what he will do after that. “April is going to be terrible, but May is going to be impossible,” he said.Montalban Oil & Gas Operations, a company with 200 wells in Montana, is planning to shut all of its wells in 10 days when its executives expect to run out of storage space. It has slashed its payroll by 25 percent, and its president, Patrick Montalban, and other senior executives have taken a 50 percent pay cut. Aside from worrying about the future, Mr. Montalban said he had been stocking up on $6 bottles of chardonnay, his drink of choice. “It’s a bloodbath out there; can you imagine minus $37 a barrel?” he said, referring to the price oil fell to on Monday. “There is something wrong with that market. It’s ridiculous.” Oil companies generally employ service companies to do their drilling and fracking, and so the downturn is particularly painful for those businesses — Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Schlumberger. Service companies have slashed payrolls and budgets in recent weeks, as have the thousands of smaller contractors that take care of things like cleaning spills, seismic testing and supplying trucks. Offshore drillers, which had done a brisk business over the last three years, have gone into a tailspin, with delays in investment decisions and canceled rig contracts. Diamond Offshore missed an interest payment on its debts last week and has hired legal and financial advisers for a potential restructuring. Latshaw Drilling, a company active in Texas and Oklahoma, has laid off 300 of its 500 employees over the last six weeks. It is operating six of its 41 rigs and dropping an additional rig next week. Trent Latshaw, the company president, said he was confident the industry would eventually come back after the virus is tamed. “If for some reason Latshaw Drilling doesn’t make it through this,” Mr. Latshaw said, “the good Lord has something else planned for me.”"
The Quiet Hand of Conservative Groups in the Anti-Lockdown Protests,"WASHINGTON — An informal coalition of influential conservative leaders and groups, some with close connections to the White House, has been quietly working to nurture protests and apply political and legal pressure to overturn state and local orders intended to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The groups have tapped their networks to drive up turnout at recent rallies in state capitals, dispatched their lawyers to file lawsuits, and paid for polling and research to undercut the arguments behind restrictions that have closed businesses and limited the movement of most Americans. Among those fighting the orders are FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots, which played pivotal roles in the beginning of Tea Party protests starting more than a decade ago. Also involved are a law firm led partly by former Trump White House officials, a network of state-based conservative policy groups, and an ad hoc coalition of conservative leaders known as Save Our Country that has advised the White House on strategies for a tiered reopening of the economy. The effort picked up some influential support on Tuesday, when Attorney General William P. Barr expressed concerns about state-level restrictions potentially infringing on constitutional rights, and suggested that, if that occurred, the Justice Department might weigh in, including by supporting legal challenges by others. Separately, in Wisconsin, Republicans in the state legislature sued to block the Democratic governor’s order extending stay-at-home rules through May 26. Those helping orchestrate the fight against restrictions predict the effort could energize the right in the same way the Tea Party movement did in 2009 and 2010, and potentially be helpful to President Trump as he campaigns for re-election. But the cause has yet to demonstrate that kind of traction.  Polls show a majority of Americans are more concerned about reopening the country too quickly than they are about the damage to the economy. And coronavirus protests have drawn smaller crowds ranging from a few dozen to several thousand at a rally in Michigan last week. Conditions are hardly ideal for a protest movement related to the virus. In addition to the health risks, demonstrators potentially face legal exposure for violating the very measures they are protesting. Plus, some key Republican leaders have embraced the types of restrictions being targeted, while powerful grass-roots mobilizing groups, including those spearheaded by the billionaire activist Charles Koch, have so far not embraced the protests. Still, the fight has emerged as a galvanizing cause for a vocal element of Mr. Trump’s base and others on the political right. Organizers see it as unifying social conservatives, who view the orders as targeting religious groups; fiscal conservatives who chafe at the economic devastation wrought by the restrictions on businesses; and civil libertarians who contend that the restrictions infringe on constitutional rights. “Groups are united in purpose on this,” said Noah Wall, advocacy director for FreedomWorks, which in 2009 organized a Tea Party protest that drew tens of thousands of people or more to Washington. He described the current efforts as appealing to a “much broader” group. “This is about people who want to get back to work and leave their homes,” he said. More than 10 protests are planned for this week, Mr. Wall said, adding that elected officials “are going to see a lot of angry activists, and I think that could change minds.” The protests mostly appear to have been organized by local residents, and are framed primarily as pushback against what they view as government overreach. But some rallies have prominently featured iconography boosting Mr. Trump and Republicans and denouncing Democrats, as well the occasional Confederate flag and signs promoting conspiracy theories. As was the case with the Tea Party movement, established national groups that generally align with the Republican Party have sought to fuel the protests, harnessing their energy in a manner that can increase their profiles and build their membership base and donor rolls. Nonprofit groups including FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots have used their social media accounts and text and email lists to spread the word about protests across the country. Most of FreedomWorks’s 40 employees are working remotely on the effort, helping to connect local protesters and set up websites for them. The group is considering paid digital advertising to further increase turnout, and has been conducting weekly tracking polls in swing suburban districts that it says show support for reopening parts of country. It is sharing the data with advisers on the president’s economic task force and other conservative allies on Capitol Hill. While social media has been a key platform for organizing the protests, those efforts have drawn scrutiny. Facebook removed some posts devoted to the protests on Monday for encouraging violations of social distancing laws. And similarities in online organizing efforts behind different protests have sparked accusations that they are not, in fact, organic grass-roots campaigns, but “astroturfing” efforts that are manipulated by Washington conservatives to appear locally driven. Organizers of recent protests in Oklahoma acknowledged that FreedomWorks helped arrange the events and said they hoped the “rolling protests,” which were intended to keep people in their vehicles, helped Mr. Trump politically. But they stressed that the events reflected real concerns from real people about the economic damage inflicted by mitigation measures. Carol Hefner, an Oklahoma co-chair of Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign who helped organize a protest last week in Oklahoma City, cited the state’s flat terrain as a factor in any decision to ease restrictions. “We have a lot of wind and the wind has pretty much helped us here,” she said. “We are in a much better position than many of the other states to go ahead and open back up.” Ronda Vuillemont-Smith, an Oklahoma HVAC contractor who helped with the capital rally and another one on Monday in Tulsa, said she encouraged protesters to remain in their vehicles. But Ms. Vuillemont-Smith, who serves on FreedomWorks’s activist advisory council, added, “I see absolutely no risks whatsoever” for open-air protests. “We are adults. We assume personal responsibility for the decisions that we make,” she said. The Oklahoma organizers and Mr. Wall, as well as the White House and the Trump campaign, said there was no coordination between the protests and Mr. Trump’s team. But the protests coincide with messages from Mr. Trump, and have been helped and organized by his supporters, some of whom have begun new ventures to advance the cause. One of them is Reopen America Political Action Committee, which aims to bring small business owners to Washington to lobby lawmakers to reopen, starting with a 24-hour rally at the White House on May 1 — the target Mr. Trump set for reopening. The group, which was created this month, has yet to report any financial activity. But its founder, Suzzanne Monk, who is active on Twitter with the handle @Trumpertarian, called the idea for the rally “pushback against these governors who want to stay shut down far beyond their economic capacity to do so.” Support for the protests features more direct ties to the White House than simply support for Mr. Trump. The administration recently formed an advisory group for reopening the economy that included Stephen Moore, the conservative economics commentator. Mr. Moore had been coordinating with FreedomWorks, the Tea Party Patriots and the American Legislative Exchange Council in a coalition called “Save Our Country,” which was formed to push for a quicker easing of restrictions. At the same time, Mr. Moore was communicating with a group of local activists in Wisconsin involved in organizing a protest at the State Capitol set for Friday. On a conservative YouTube program that went online the day Mr. Trump named him to the task force, Mr. Moore said he had “one big donor in Wisconsin” who had pledged financial support for the protesters, telling him, “‘Steve, I promise, I will pay the bail and legal fees of anyone who gets arrested.’” In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Moore declined to identify the donor, but said, “I do think you’re going to see these start to erupt.” He said he would probably turn down an invitation to speak at the protest in Wisconsin, because “it’s important that no one be under the impression that it’s sponsored or directed by national groups in Washington.” A legal offensive against the restrictions is also being waged by groups and individuals supportive of Mr. Trump. Mr. Barr’s comments on Tuesday came a few days after a letter sent by groups including FreedomWorks, Tea Party Patriots and the anti-abortion-rights group Susan B. Anthony List urging the Justice Department to consider intervening to block restrictions that the officials said were unconstitutional infringements on civil liberties.  Lawyers aligned with socially conservative causes have filed their own lawsuits against governors.Many are focused on allowing smaller churches to keep holding services, but the objections cover a range of other activities. In Michigan, a lawsuit is challenging provisions of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s executive order banning travel to vacation homes and gatherings of non-household members. A law firm that advises the Trump Organization, Michael Best & Friedrich, is representing members of a new protest group in North Carolina called ReOpenNC. Michael Best’s ranks include the former Trump chief of staff Reince Priebus, the former deputy White House counsel Stefan C. Passantino and the current senior counsel at the Trump campaign, Justin Clark. ReOpenNC had told its members that a “generous donor” had arranged to pay for buses to bring protesters to Raleigh from around the state. But, in a sign of how loath the groups are to be viewed as “astroturf” creations, the group said it had scrapped the plan when a news station, WRAL, asked about it. (Afterward, a former defense contractor and perennial North Carolina political candidate, Tim D’Annunzio, stepped forward on Facebook to say he was the donor and was still hoping to run the buses.) On Friday, Anthony J. Biller, a Raleigh-based lawyer with Michael Best, wrote to Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, on behalf of a ReOpenNC co-founder, Kristen Elizabeth, and a member who was arrested at a protest last week, seeking dismissal of the charges. In an interview, Mr. Biller said he hoped the state would agree to allow ReOpenNC to demonstrate safely without fear of arrest, adding, “What is sufficient safety to buy toilet paper at Costco should be sufficient safety to practice one’s fundamental rights, particularly about these issues.” He said that he was working pro bono but that there was “no coordination with the Trump administration, as some bozos have implied.” One force in conservative politics that has kept its distance from the stay-at-home protests is the network of groups backed by the billionaire Mr. Koch. The largest Koch-backed group, Americans for Prosperity, which played a leading role in facilitating the Tea Party movement, has remained on the sidelines of the coronavirus protests. GoDaddy records show that a public relations firm tied to the Koch network, In Pursuit Of LLC, registered the domain name “reopenmississippi.com.” An official said the group had planned to use the site to highlight a nuanced approach being developed by the network to reopen the economy while balancing health concerns. “The question is — what is the best way to get people back to work?” said Emily Seidel, the chief executive of Americans for Prosperity. “We don’t see protests as the best way to do that,” she said, adding that “the choice between full shutdown and immediately opening everything is a false choice.”Reid J.

Dan Scavino Promoted as Meadows Shuffles White House Communications Team,"Dan Scavino, the White House director of social media who sometimes operates President Trump’s Twitter feed, has been promoted to deputy chief of staff for communications, officials said on Tuesday. Mr. Scavino’s appointment was one of a handful announced by the White House as the new chief of staff, Mark Meadows, the fourth person to hold the job under Mr. Trump, shakes up the communications team. It remains to be seen what the change in title means for Mr. Scavino, who is one of the original aides in the president’s 2016 campaign and was general manager of the Trump National Golf Club Westchester in New York. Mr. Scavino, a constant presence whether the president is in the White House or traveling, flags content from the internet for his boss and is said to be the only aide with access to Mr. Trump’s personal Twitter account. He is one of the advisers Mr. Trump trusts without reservation. But it is unclear what his responsibilities will be in the communications shop. According to administration officials, he traditionally has not attended the senior staff meetings that other top advisers do, for instance. Other appointments included John C. Fleming, a doctor who served four terms as a congressman from Louisiana and most recently as assistant secretary of commerce, who will be an assistant to the president for “planning and implementation.” Nick Luna, who has served as Mr. Trump’s “body man,” will be an assistant to the president and director of Oval Office operations. And two new aides, Alyssa Farah and Kayleigh McEnany, were promoted to assistants to the president. Both started recently as deputy assistants. Ms. Farah is the director of strategic communications and Ms. McEnany is the new press secretary, the fourth since Mr. Trump became president."
"Senate Approves Aid for Small-Business Loan Program, Hospitals and Testing","WASHINGTON — The Senate approved a $484 billion coronavirus relief package on Tuesday that would revive a depleted loan program for distressed small businesses and provide funds for hospitals and coronavirus testing, breaking a partisan impasse over the latest infusion of federal money to address the public health and economic crisis brought on by the pandemic. The measure was the product of an intense round of negotiations between Democrats and the Trump administration that unfolded as the small-business loan program created by the $2.2 trillion stimulus law quickly ran out of funding, collapsing under a glut of applications from desperate companies struggling to stay afloat. But it was only a fraction of the amount of money that Congress will most likely consider in the weeks to come, as lawmakers contemplate spending another $1 trillion or more on yet another sweeping government response to the pandemic, and Democrats vow to revisit items that the administration and Republicans insisted on leaving aside for a future bill. At the insistence of Democrats, the measure would provide $25 billion for testing and a mandate that the Trump administration establish a national strategy to help states and localities, which are required to outline their own plans for testing. It is a step that public health experts and governors have said will be crucial to allowing states and sectors of the economy to safely reopen in the weeks and months to come, although economists and health researchers say the funding is a fraction of what will ultimately be necessary to deploy the kind of testing and tracing that will be needed to restart large amounts of activity by the summer. That provision — which the White House and Republican leaders had initially resisted — was one of a host of concessions that Democrats won during more than a week of intense negotiations in which they demanded that the money for the small-business loan program be coupled with funds for other urgent needs. The resulting deal would bring to $2.7 trillion the amount of federal aid that Congress has approved in the past six weeks — including jobless aid, direct payments to individuals, a corporate bailout and other help for strapped businesses — in an unprecedented effort to respond to the pandemic and the economic chaos it has wrought. It came as Southern states took their first tentative steps toward reopening, even in the face of warnings from public health experts against moving too quickly. The death toll from the virus climbed past 39,000, and the stock market fell for a second straight day, as global markets retreated and oil prices continued their record slide. Even as the measure was being completed, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York met with President Trump at the White House to press for more federal assistance to expand testing for the virus and more funds to help financially devastated state and local governments. The Senate approval came two weeks after Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, first asked Congress for an expedited infusion of $250 billion to shore up the newly created loan program for distressed small businesses, known as the Paycheck Protection Program. Since Mr. Mnuchin’s request, funding has lapsed and the program has been unable to process applications for millions of companies. But Democrats rejected the administration’s request to pass a stand-alone bill funding the program and called for a package twice as large, proposing more money for hospitals, testing and state and local governments. Republicans, for their part, said they agreed with most of the Democratic requests — but initially advocated addressing additional funding in future legislation. “We are coming together — we have our usual arguments and talking points,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, in an interview after the vote. “But in the end, we did come together for the country.” The measure would provide $320 billion for the small-business loan program, with $60 billion set aside for smaller lending institutions, in line with Democrats’ request to steer resources to businesses that typically have trouble getting loans. The package would also add $60 billion for the Small Business Administration’s disaster relief funds — divided into $50 billion in loans and $10 billion in grants — and farms and other agriculture enterprises would be made eligible. There would also be $75 billion for hospitals, though Democrats failed to secure additional funds for state and local governments, or an expansion of food assistance they had championed. Republicans “have seen the light — we had a great victory for the American people,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said during a news conference at the Capitol after the vote. “But we certainly need to do more.” Even as he hailed the agreement, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said it should have contained far more for states and localities that are struggling under the burdens of the pandemic. “The efforts of individual states or individual citizens — heroic as they are — will not be enough, and we dare not abandon them in these dark times,” he said. “The American people need their government. They need their government to act strongly, boldly and wisely.” The House was expected to pass the measure on Thursday, clearing it for Mr. Trump, who indicated in a post on Twitter that he would sign it. Once he did, the president wrote, discussions would begin over yet another round of coronavirus relief that would include money for state and local governments, investments in infrastructure, tax incentives for restaurants, entertainment and sports and payroll tax cuts, the latter of which has repeatedly been rejected by lawmakers in both parties. The impasse remained charged until minutes before the vote on Tuesday afternoon, as negotiators haggled over the final details. The Senate passed the measure by voice vote — a necessity because most senators were not present as the chamber had been in a prolonged recess — after two Republican senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, raised objections to the cost of the package and its approval without the full chamber present. “Even more alarming than the money is the idea that one senator can stand on the floor and pass legislation spending half a trillion dollars and have no recorded vote and no debate,” said Mr. Paul, a libertarian. He said he had returned to Washington “so that history will record that not everyone gave in to the massive debt Congress is creating.” House Republicans were expected to force a roll-call vote that would summon members back to Washington to vote on the package, which is expected to come as early as Thursday morning. “We are asking every member to return who can return, and we hope that is a large number,” Representative Steny H. Hoyer, Democrat of Maryland, said on Tuesday. But the vote might be the last one for some time under which a majority of the House would have to be physically present. Democratic leaders were expected to move this week to change the rules to allow lawmakers to vote remotely by proxy, a historic step that would reduce the number of representatives who would need to return to Washington during the pandemic. In contrast, Mr. McConnell predicted that the Senate would not try to approve another legislative response to the pandemic without all 100 senators back in Washington and negotiating in person. “We ought to bring everyone back and have full participation, begin to think about the implications to the country’s future with this level of national debt,” he said at a news conference. While negotiators agreed to increase the administration’s original request, it was unclear how long the new funds could sustain the program, which had a rocky rollout that stretched the capacity of the Small Business Administration, the small federal agency overseeing it. It took only 13 days to exhaust the original tranche of $349 billion, which covered more than 1.6 million loans from nearly 5,000 lenders — more than 14 years’ worth of loans typically processed by the agency. And the program has been criticized for failing to reach the businesses that needed it most, after it emerged that large restaurant chains had gotten money while many smaller companies were unable to. Congress is likely to face calls to expand the program further, increasing the range of small businesses that could receive loans, and to provide still more funding. White House officials acknowledged that they would soon be back at the table for new talks.“We’ve got to get through this stimulus, and then it’s on to the next stimulus,” Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the National Economic Council, told reporters. Mr. Schumer, Mr. Mnuchin, Ms. Pelosi and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, negotiated Monday night and into the wee hours of Tuesday morning in an effort to resolve an impasse over Democrats’ demands for a national testing strategy, as well as their call for more money for state and local governments. The two Democratic leaders vowed to continue pushing for the additional funds in future measures, as well as hazard pay for front-line workers, worker protections, election security funds and food assistance. Republicans have so far resisted the inclusion of most of those provisions in the four packages that have now passed through the Senate. “I’m not doing anything that’s non-coronavirus related,” Mr. McConnell said in the interview, though he acknowledged that efforts to supply more funding to state and local governments would prompt “a big debate, and we’ll do it when we’re all back here together.” The National Governors Association continued to call for a half-trillion dollars to help counter budgetary shortfalls, as well as other investments to support states, and Mr. Cuomo was particularly scathing about the measure. “I think it’s a terrible mistake not to provide money for the states,” he said in Buffalo before traveling to Washington to meet with Mr. Trump. “I get small businesses, I get airlines. How about police? How about fire? How about health care workers? How about teachers? We’re not going to fund schools? I don’t get it.” The measure would steer $11 billion of the money for testing to states, and mandate that states, localities, territories and tribes also create their own plans for testing and mitigation. It would also provide more money to the federal government for testing, including $1 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, $1.8 billion for the National Institutes of Health, $1 billion for testing those without health insurance, and $22 million for the Food and Drug Administration. There would also be $1 billion allocated for the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and $825 million for community health centers, rural health centers and other health institutions. And it would set aside $6 million for the Department of Health Human Services inspector general to conduct oversight.Catie Edmondson contributed reporting from Washington, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta."
Republican-Led Review Backs Intelligence Findings on Russian Interference,"WASHINGTON — For years, President Trump has derided the assessment by American intelligence officials that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election to assist his candidacy, dismissing it without evidence as the work of a “deep state” out to undermine his victory. But on Tuesday, a long-awaited Senate review led by members of Mr. Trump’s own party effectively undercut those allegations. A three-year review by the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee unanimously found that the intelligence community assessment, pinning blame on Russia and outlining its goals to undercut American democracy, was fundamentally sound and untainted by politics. “The I.C.A. reflects strong tradecraft, sound analytical reasoning and proper justification of disagreement in the one analytical line where it occurred,” said Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the panel’s chairman. “The committee found no reason to dispute the intelligence community’s conclusions.” The endorsement by Mr. Burr’s committee comes at a key moment for the intelligence agencies. Not only has Mr. Trump moved in recent months to install a loyalist in the top spy position, but Attorney General William P. Barr has also blessed a broad review of possible misconduct by investigators examining the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia, apparently including work by intelligence officials. The federal prosecutor whom Mr. Barr appointed to review the government’s response to Russian election interference, John H. Durham, is examining whether the C.I.A. or other intelligence agencies overstated President Vladimir V. Putin’s support of the Trump campaign, a central finding of the 2017 assessment. His team has interviewed intelligence analysts, questioning whether Obama-era intelligence officials hid evidence or manipulated analysis about Moscow’s covert operation, people familiar with the Durham inquiry have said. Some of Mr. Trump’s allies immediately criticized the Senate report; Fred Fleitz, a former C.I.A. officer who briefly served in the Trump administration, dismissed it as “a whitewash.” Many Republicans believe that the intelligence agencies overstated Russia’s support for Mr. Trump and argue that Moscow was trying to sow chaos in the United States, not support any one candidate. The report released Tuesday was the latest installment in an inquiry by the Senate Intelligence Committee into the broader Russia matter. Senators are expected to release one final chapter in the coming months examining contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. When the inquiry began in early 2017, it was one of the most closely followed in the history of Congress, casting a cloud over Mr. Trump’s presidency that could not be dismissed as merely partisan. But with the investigation into the same topic by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, long since put to rest; an impeachment fight over a largely unrelated matter behind the country; and a pandemic reshaping nearly every aspect of life, the Russia inquiry has now largely become an afterthought for most Americans. The Senate Intelligence Committee had already given the work of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. an interim stamp of approval, but the 158-page report released on Tuesday presented new detail about the government’s attempts in late 2016 and early 2017 to make sense of Russia’s attacks. Much of the report’s contents were considered highly sensitive and blacked out by the Trump administration before release. In their report, senators essentially said they had asked the same questions that Mr. Durham is now examining and found that the intelligence agencies’ work stood up, even if it was conducted in a compressed time frame to be finished before President Barack Obama left office in January 2017. “The case is closed,” said Senator Angus King, independent of Maine. “I don’t know how you could have a much more credible source than a three-year study by a bipartisan committee that came to a unanimous conclusion.” Critics of the assessment have focused on the fact that the National Security Agency had a lower level of confidence than the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. on the conclusion that Mr. Putin supported Mr. Trump’s election. Mr. Durham, they believe, can provide proof. But the committee found that the differing confidence levels among the intelligence agencies were “justified and properly represented.” The report said that both John O. Brennan, then the director of the C.I.A., and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, then the director of the National Security Agency, both “independently expressed to the committee that they reached the final wording openly and with sufficient exchanges of views.” Senators said their inquiry found that intelligence analysts who worked on the assessment were “under no politically motivated pressure to reach specific conclusions.” “All analysts expressed that they were free to debate, object to content and assess confidence levels, as is normal and proper for the analytic process,” the report said. It also examined the inclusion of material from a well-known dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence officer whom the F.B.I. referred to by the code name “Crown,” showing purported ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. The document included unverified, salacious accusations about Mr. Trump and has become a focus of Mr. Trump’s allies, who have sought to conflate it with the much broader Justice Department investigation into Russia’s election interference. Though elements of the dossier were included in an annex to the intelligence assessment, it “was not used in the body of the I.C.A. or to support any of its analytic judgments,” the senators found. Even the decision to include it in the annex was made reluctantly, the senators wrote. The F.B.I. did not want to vouch for its veracity but felt that because Mr. Obama had ordered the assessment to include all relevant material, his directive required the dossier’s inclusion. The Senate report stood in contrast to the conclusions in 2018 of the House Intelligence Committee, then under Republican control, which took issue in its own report on Russian election interference with intelligence officials’ conclusion that Mr. Putin had tried to harm Hillary Clinton and help Mr. Trump. The House committee cited breakdowns in “proper analytic tradecraft,” but many House Republicans who were involved later disavowed that conclusion. Earlier volumes released by the Senate committee chronicled Russia’s active measures campaign to interfere in the 2016 election and outlined potential policy measures to blunt future attacks on election infrastructure, examined the use of social media to sow political divisions in the United States and critiqued the response by the Obama administration and Congress to Russia’s attacks in the run-up to the last presidential election. The committee is expected to release a final bipartisan installment in the coming months evaluating possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia. A draft runs over 900 pages but has yet to be submitted for classification review by intelligence agencies, a process that could take weeks or months. The findings are likely to mirror those in the Mueller report. His team documented voluminous contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, including a willingness by Mr. Trump’s team to accept Russian assistance during the election, but concluded that it had insufficient evidence to charge any campaign official with conspiracy. More recently, Mr. Burr, who slowly pushed his bipartisan investigation forward despite calls from Mr. Trump to disband it, has come under intense scrutiny for a decision to liquidate much of his stock portfolio in February, before the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the financial markets. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department have taken preliminary steps to investigate whether the sales had been based on nonpublic information Mr. Burr received on the Intelligence Committee or through other Senate work, a potential violation of the law. Mr. Burr noted that Russia had continued efforts to interfere in American politics, and he said the warnings of three years ago still must be heeded. “Russia and its imitators increasingly use information warfare to sow societal chaos and discord,” Mr. Burr said. “With the 2020 presidential election approaching, it’s more important than ever that we remain vigilant against the threat of interference from hostile foreign actors.” Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the committee’s top Democrat, concurred and warned that Russia’s success in 2016 would embolden the Kremlin to continue to interfere in American democracy."
"At Least 7 in Wisconsin Got Coronavirus During Voting, Officials Say","Milwaukee health officials said they had identified at least seven people who contracted the coronavirus from participating in Election Day on April 7, which was held despite a stay-at-home order issued throughout the state. The seven people were the first identified by Milwaukee officials, who contend that the number may be higher as they are still conducting testing. Other cities have not reported any cases tied to voting yet. The officials, in a statement issued Tuesday, did not say how they traced the new coronavirus cases to in-person voting. Six of the cases they identified were Milwaukee voters; the seventh was a poll worker. Polling places opened across Wisconsin after the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature refused to take action to postpone the election or expand vote by mail. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services said it would also be studying any voters or election workers who contracted the virus from voting. They have not reported any cases yet. “Please note that we only have 30 percent of the data back from new cases as of 4/7 and on,” said Jeanette Kowalik, the Milwaukee health commissioner, in the statement. “We hope to have these fields complete by Friday and will provide a more complete report then.” Dr. Kowalik said that the data was still incomplete because some patients may have declined to provide complete information, were delayed in presenting symptoms, or experienced delays in testing and processing. She added that they were looking at any new cases that began after April 7 as the incubation period is 14 days, which ends April 21. Before the election, thousands of poll workers, many of whom are older and are considered high risk for the coronavirus, said they would not be able to work during the in-person election, resulting in a severely depleted election staff in many parts of the state. In Milwaukee, that meant its 180 polling locations were drastically reduced to just five. Voters across the city cited waits of well over two hours throughout the day. The direct connection of contracting coronavirus from in-person voting in Wisconsin could further increase calls across the country for an expansion of vote by mail and absentee voting for the November elections. There are multiple bills currently in the U.S. Senate seeking billions of dollars to vastly expand vote by mail before the November election. Democrats in Congress are also pushing to get more funding for the elections into the next stimulus plan."
On Politics: Trump Pledges to Halt Immigration,"Good morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday. Where things standPresident Trump announced on Twitter last night that he would use an executive order to suspend all immigration into the United States in an attempt to quell the spread of the coronavirus. In recent weeks the administration had already barred asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants from entering the country, prompting objections from advocacy groups that he was using the crisis to further his anti-immigration agenda. As the virus spreads throughout the United States, and as his critics argue that he has not done enough to confront the pandemic, Trump has often pointed to his decision in late January to bar travel from China as evidence that he was working to confront it. A dispute over virus testing is at the heart of the latest standoff in Washington: House Democrats say they are close to a deal with the president on the next phase of federal virus relief, but before they sign off they want a nationwide testing plan included in the bill. The legislation is already likely to include $25 billion for testing, as well as more than $300 billion in new loans for small businesses, and $75 billion for hospitals, but Republicans have thus far resisted instituting a national testing framework. The Senate’s Republican leadership has scheduled a session for 4 p.m. today, suggesting that it expects Trump and the Democrats to have come to an agreement by then. But on Monday, the president once again argued on Twitter that “States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing.”Protesters have gathered in states across the country over the past week, defying stay-at-home orders and demanding that their governors — in most cases, Democrats or moderate Republicans — lift lockdown restrictions. In Kentucky, where a number of well-attended protests have occurred, the Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, announced over the weekend that the state had begun to experience a higher rate of infection. Beshear has said that he will not begin to lift restrictions until the state’s infection rate has been in decline for 14 consecutive days. But some other Southern states are moving to reopen, making them canaries in the mine as the nation wonders when a return to public life will become safe. In South Carolina, many retail stores will be allowed to reopen today after the governor decided to ignore federal health officials’ recommendations. Georgia is set to follow by the end of the week, and in Tennessee, the governor has indicated that he will let stay-at-home restrictions in many places lapse on May 1.Nearly three-quarters of the inmate population at a prison in Ohio has tested positive for the virus, making it the country’s leading single source of reported infections, with over 1,800. Across the country, from North Carolina to Louisiana to California, jails and prisons are considered among the highest-risk places to be during the pandemic because of their crowded conditions. Some cities and states — including New York and California — have begun to release a limited number of nonviolent offenders in order to reduce crowding. But prisoners’ rights advocates continue to argue that the virus warrants a more widespread reduction to the prison population.Perhaps not surprisingly, many of Trump’s disgraced allies are seeking to jump the line and get out of prison now, arguing that the virus puts them at undue risk. Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, former top officials on Trump’s campaign who are now behind bars, have filed separate motions asking to serve the rest of their sentences at home. It’s also possible that the president could use the virus as an opportunity to grant clemency to some of his allies. When asked at a news conference on Sunday whether he was considering issuing more pardons, Trump pointed to Manafort, Roger Stone and Michael Flynn as people who had been “treated unfairly,” adding: “What am I going to do? You’ll find out what I’m going to do.” Photo of the day President Trump during the daily coronavirus briefing at the White House on Monday. Klobuchar, whose husband has struggled with the virus, sits down for a chat with Biden.By Katie GlueckAmy Klobuchar, a Democratic senator from Minnesota and a potential vice-presidential pick for Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, joined Biden on his podcast for a wide-ranging conversation that quickly took on a strikingly personal tone. At a time when many voters are more focused on their own vulnerability than on the politics of a general election, Klobuchar spoke to Biden about her husband’s battle with the coronavirus, though he is now on the mend. Speaking on Monday’s episode of the podcast, “Here’s the Deal,” she called it “the most lonely, horrific disease.” Biden, whose first wife and daughter died in a car crash and whose son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015, has sought to use his personal experiences with grief to connect with struggling voters. That goal has been made more difficult these days by social distancing, and by the fact that Trump enjoys the bully pulpit of the presidency amid the crisis. Klobuchar suggested that Biden’s “empathy” was a critical factor in her decision to support him, a choice that helped put wind in his sails on the eve of Super Tuesday. And she previewed a contrast Democrats are hoping to draw with Trump over matters of character. “That sense that you have, which has marked your whole life from your own losses, of empathy, is something that we are missing right now in the White House,” Klobuchar said.

"Vote by Mail in Wisconsin Helped a Liberal Candidate, Upending Old Theories","The liberal candidate in Wisconsin’s hard-fought State Supreme Court race this month prevailed in voting by mail by a significant margin, upending years of study showing little advantage to either party when a state transitions from in-person to mail voting. The gap suggests that Democrats were more organized and proactive in their vote-by-mail efforts in an election conducted under extraordinary circumstances, with voters forced to weigh the health risks of voting in person against the sometimes unreliable option of requesting and mailing in their ballots. Still, it is likely to add to the skepticism President Trump and Republicans have expressed about mail voting, which they worry would increase Democratic turnout at Republicans’ expense. The liberal jurist, Jill Karofsky, performed 10 percentage points better than her conservative opponent in votes cast by mail than she did in votes cast at Election Day polling places, a gap that powered a surprising 11-point victory over all in a state both parties view as crucial to winning November’s presidential election. The voting data, collected by The New York Times from 27 Wisconsin municipalities that segregate ballots cast on Election Day from those sent by mail, shows that Judge Karofsky’s advantage in mail ballots over the conservative incumbent, Justice Daniel Kelly, was consistent across communities of varying size, geography and partisan lean. In a state with little history of voting by mail, more than 1.1 million of 1.55 million votes cast came by mail. The Times analysis of Wisconsin records shows a staggering gap between in-person and mail voting in some communities. At a single precinct, Beloit’s 11th Ward, Justice Kelly won 64 percent of the Election Day vote while Judge Karofsky took 70 percent of votes cast by mail. Barry Burden, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who is among the academics who have produced studies that found no partisan advantage to mail voting, said the Times analysis of the Wisconsin data did not align with any previous studies from states such as Colorado and Utah, which transitioned to fully vote-by-mail systems in recent years. “I’m surprised by the results,” Mr. Burden said when told of the gap between in-person and mail results. “It is convincing and surprising that Karofsky appears to have done better among mail voters than in-person voters. That’s a change from past trends. It’s unclear if that’s going to be a permanent change or something very specific to this particular election.” Judge Karofsky performed better in the mail voting in every Wisconsin community in which results were made available to The Times. In Milwaukee, the state’s largest city, her performance among mail ballots was 5.8 points better than it was on Election Day, when voters waited in line for hours to vote at the five polling places that remained open. Even in the Republican heartland of Waukesha County, Judge Karofsky performed far better among mail voters than she did on Election Day. In New Berlin, she won just 33 percent of votes at polling sites, but 43 percent in the mail, where four in five of the city’s votes were cast. In the City of Pewaukee, she took 27 percent of the Election Day vote and 37 percent of the mail ballots. The pattern helped Judge Karofsky carry swing communities that are crucial to winning statewide races in Wisconsin. In Neenah, in the Fox Valley south of Green Bay, Justice Kelly won the Election Day vote, 53 percent to 47 percent. But Judge Karofsky took 60 percent of the mail ballots. She won the citywide vote, 58 percent to 42 percent. None of the academic studies cited as evidence that there was no partisan advantage to mail voting had been able to segregate mail voting results from in-person ones for a single election. Such results are available from Wisconsin’s April 7 election because 32 of the state’s municipalities, including Milwaukee, count absentee ballots at a central location using separate tabulating equipment. The state’s other 1,800 cities, villages and towns do not segregate absentee ballots from those cast on Election Day when counting them, according to Reid Magney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission. Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University who has helped put in place vote-by-mail systems across the country, said the Wisconsin results showed the ability of Democrats there to build a statewide vote-by-mail system essentially from scratch just weeks before the election. “You probably had much more core frequent and Democratic voters voting by mail and late-deciding voters waiting to vote at the polls,” he said. “The Democrats proved they can mobilize their voters to vote by mail.” The gap in mail voting may have been influenced by the diverging concerns about the coronavirus pandemic among Wisconsin’s Democrats and Republicans. A Marquette Law School poll released six days before the election found 87 percent of Democrats were very concerned about the coronavirus, compared with just 56 percent of Republicans. Amelia Showalter, the data analytics director for Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign, said the Wisconsin results might change the perception of mail voting. “The people who used it were older voters who voted more Republican,” Ms. Showalter said. “As you get more widespread adoption, you get into more of those low-propensity voters. It might advantage Democrats.” Ben Wikler, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, attributed Judge Karofsky’s success in mail voting to the party’s mid-March decision to focus entirely on educating Democrats about how to request and complete a mail ballot. “The Democratic Party decided weeks out from the election to switch 100 percent of its efforts to vote-by-mail in the first time in its history,” Mr. Wikler said. “I think Republicans bought some of their own disinformation.” Wisconsin Republicans acknowledged that the state’s Democrats became far more invested in encouraging their voters to request and return absentee ballots before this month’s election. “They were invested in doing this starting as early as the first week in March,” said Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly who, on Election Day, was photographed in full personal protective equipment during his stint as a poll monitor in his hometown, Burlington. “I would say that, stereotyping, Republicans like to go vote on Election Day.” Mr. Vos said the Wisconsin election was evidence that no changes in the state’s voting laws and procedures are necessary before the November general election, when twice as many people are expected to vote. Democratic requests to mail ballots to all registered voters and to remove requirements that voters upload a photo identification to request an absentee ballot and obtain a witness signature before returning ballots are out of the question, Mr. Vos said. “The only reason they would want to expand voting would be to create an opportunity for potential fraud or because they want to give themselves some kind of partisan advantage,” Mr. Vos said. “The current situation is pretty fair to everybody.” Mr. Vos and other senior Wisconsin Republicans rejected the idea that Mr. Trump’s repeated dismissal of mail voting depressed conservative voters’ interest in voting absentee. “The daily hubbub in Washington, that stuff doesn’t necessarily break through with our voters,” said Brian Reisinger, who served as a senior aide to former Gov. Scott Walker and Senator Ron Johnson. Yet there was some acknowledgment that the G.O.P.’s political apparatus in Wisconsin, which built a powerful get-out-the-vote machine that elected Mr. Walker three times and gave Mr. Trump a shocking 2016 victory, was slow to adapt to a rapidly changing public health situation. “The right is more rigid,” said Matt Batzel, the Cedar Grove, Wis.-based national executive director of American Majority Action, a conservative grass-roots training organization. “People on the right need to use the rules of the game and use all the voting opportunities that are available.”"
Joe Biden Starts General Election Nearly $187 Million Behind Trump,"Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Democratic Party could raise almost $1 million every single day between now and November, and he would still barely catch up to what President Trump and the Republican Party had in the bank at the start of April — let alone what Mr. Trump will have by Election Day. New fund-raising figures released late Monday show the depth of the financial hole in which Mr. Biden finds himself at the start of the general election campaign: The presumptive Democratic nominee and his party are nearly $187 million behind the Republican National Committee and Mr. Trump, who has spent the last three years stockpiling his huge war chest. The sheer size of Mr. Trump’s early advantage creates a unique set of financial and political pressures for Mr. Biden. He must find ways to both expand his appeal to small online contributors and attract huge seven- and eight-figure checks to the outside super PACs supporting him — all while sheltered in his Delaware home because of the coronavirus. To lure the money that he will need to compete effectively in battleground states, Mr. Biden will have to navigate a series of consequential political decisions, refining his message, honing his policy agenda and selecting his running mate. But Democratic strategists say he has at least one point in his favor: He has wrapped up the nomination and started uniting the party relatively early in 2020, giving focus to the party activists and leading financial patrons who are singularly obsessed with defeating Mr. Trump. “Trump’s clear lane is one of the huge benefits of incumbency, and he has used that advantage to turn the screws on every possible donor and execute a massive digital fund-raising effort,” said Jim Margolis, a Democratic strategist and veteran of past presidential campaigns. “So, yes, there will be a fund-raising imbalance, but I think Biden will have enough money to run a good campaign.” The current cash gap at the presidential level is especially striking because down-ballot Democrats in key House and Senate races have been out-raising their Republican rivals. From competitive Senate races in Maine and Arizona to longer-shot contests in Kentucky and South Carolina, Democratic candidates out-raised their rivals in numerous Republican-held seats across the country in the first quarter of 2020. Adding to the sense of fiscal strain at the top of the ticket, Mr. Biden has not yet struck an agreement to collect big checks in tandem with the Democratic National Committee (though one is expected soon); the Milwaukee host committee of the Democratic convention announced layoffs last week; and his campaign has been relatively slow to expand hiring since he seized control of the nominating contest a month ago. Top party operatives and donors have been further distracted by a fractious turf war between leading Democratic super PACs jockeying for supremacy in the crucial and lucrative business of supporting Mr. Biden and ousting Mr. Trump on the airwaves. Even as the Biden campaign has sought to resolve the matter in recent days, some donors and advisers said they were still unsure where exactly they should be sending their checks. Money is not always determinative in politics, especially at the presidential level. Mr. Biden won the 2020 primary despite being badly outspent. And Mr. Trump won the White House in 2016 despite spending far less than Hillary Clinton. But cash provides campaigns precious flexibility: allowing them to expand the electoral map, hire more staff members, buy more ads or even run political experiments at a moment when a pandemic has caused unprecedented societal upheaval. Michael Halle, a former top adviser to Pete Buttigieg, said that while money could present a challenge for Mr. Biden, the coronavirus had already robbed Mr. Trump of a great advantage of incumbency: the ability to develop and plan out a political strategy. Mr. Trump had telegraphed his intent to rally around the robust economy; instead, there are record jobless claims. “Yes, they have the money,” Mr. Halle said of the Republicans. “But to me the bigger power of incumbency is those other pieces. And those are gone.” The good news for Democrats is that March was Mr. Biden’s best fund-raising month of the campaign by far, raising $46.7 million. The bad news: His pace slowed markedly in the second half as the pandemic gripped the nation and froze the economy. On ActBlue, which processes online donations for Democrats, Mr. Biden raised $27.3 million in the first 15 days of March — the period when he took control of the nomination race — and only $8.5 million in the final 16 days, according to new Federal Election Commission records.  Mr. Trump and his shared committees with the R.N.C. raised $63 million in March and entered April with a combined $244 million in cash on hand. Mr. Biden and the D.N.C. had $57.2 million in the bank, after accounting for unpaid debts. After a quiet first few weeks in Wilmington, Mr. Biden has begun to ramp up his remote fund-raising schedule. His campaign has scheduled at least 14 events from mid-April to early May, including two events this week featuring former rivals, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Cory Booker. “We are watching Joe Biden unite the Democratic Party before our eyes, and the full weight of the Party’s resources and network will be behind him moving forward,” said Penny Pritzker, a former Commerce secretary who has been advising the campaign. Super PACs — which can accept unlimited donations but are legally barred from strategizing with the campaign itself — will be critical to keeping Mr. Biden competitive in online and television advertising, according to Democratic strategists. The Biden campaign’s decision last week to single out one super PAC, Priorities USA, above the others in a statement to The Wall Street Journal set off an intense round of rancor that one top fund-raiser likened to a “nuclear bomb” in the political money world. Donors, super PAC strategists and campaign officials have spent much of the last week engaged in shuttle diplomacy to smooth matters over. Priorities USA, which has existed for the last two presidential cycles, did not support Mr. Biden in the primaries and has some vocal critics among donors who hold the group partly accountable for Mrs. Clinton’s surprise 2016 loss. Among those in Mr. Biden’s orbit who have expressed reservations in the past about Priorities is Steve Ricchetti, a senior Biden adviser and the campaign chairman. Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, a top Biden endorser and adviser, had worked with a different pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, during the primaries and expressed his displeasure privately as well publicly, saying in an interview that the decision to single out one group was a “mistake.” “I said before and I’ll say again, I didn’t know who Priorities was,” said Mr. Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House. “Unite the Country — that’s who I worked with, that’s who I’m still working with.” As the Biden campaign considered which outside group to endorse, Unite the Country recently added Mr. Clyburn’s daughter, Jennifer Clyburn Reed, as an unpaid board member and announced an alliance with another Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, with a goal of raising $175 million. Those groups were disappointed with the Biden campaign’s initial endorsement of Priorities and, two days later, the campaign put out a second statement that recognized “a community of organizations that have contributions to make” in supporting the candidate. The campaign reissued that same statement for this article, and said its position had never changed and the clarification was only because of misinterpretation. “We are pleased that the Biden campaign has recognized how critical American Bridge and its programs are to his election,” said Bradley Beychok, the president of American Bridge. “Since day one our mission has been to defeat Donald Trump and we have no plans to let up. We know our program will make a difference.” On Friday, American Bridge announced a $15 million ad buy in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin over the next two weeks. On Monday, Priorities USA announced $65 million in its own ad reservations for the fall in six states. The day that the Biden campaign signaled its support of Priorities USA, the group announced a new “partners advisory council” that included Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan and the chairwoman of American Bridge. But Ms. Granholm was so frustrated with the rollout and announcement that she had told people she was considering resigning that new post, according to three people briefed on the matter. She has since decided to stay on. “We believe a coordinated effort gives Democrats the best chance to win in November,” she said on Monday in a joint statement with Deval Patrick, the vice chair of American Bridge. Priorities USA also announced that it was adding Bill Knapp, a political ad maker, to its media team, which drew attention from donors aligned with other groups. Mr. Knapp is a business partner of the top Biden adviser Anita Dunn at the firm SKDKnickerbocker. Priorities said that Mr. Knapp would only be paid a retainer and was not receiving a percentage of the group’s advertising budget. The Biden campaign said that Ms. Dunn had played no role in the blessing of Priorities as the leading super PAC. Democratic donors are already trying to fill the financial breach. The billionaire financier George Soros directed nearly $28 million to various Democratic super PACs and organizations in the first three months of the year. Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, redirected $18 million of leftover funds from his failed 2020 campaign to the D.N.C. There are typically far stricter limits on party donations, but Mr. Bloomberg pioneered a loophole to give the vast sum as a former candidate. Despite the super PAC infighting, Democrats have taken solace in the swiftness of the party’s unification. Senator Bernie Sanders not only offered a full-throated endorsement last week to Mr. Biden, his former rival, but also later said it would be “irresponsible” for his supporters to not line up behind the former vice president. Former President Barack Obama followed with his own formal backing, as did Senator Elizabeth Warren. Those two endorsements sparked more than $5 million in donations over two days, Mr. Biden told donors, one of his strongest stretches of the campaign. “Time is a much more precious resource than money, and he just had a lot of time handed over to him,” said Robby Mook, who served as Mrs. Clinton’s campaign manager, noting that Mr. Sanders formally endorsed Mr. Biden three months earlier than he lined up behind Mrs. Clinton in 2016. “If money was the key,” Mr. Mook added, “2016 would have gone very differently.”Rachel Shorey contributed reporting."
Trump Plans to Suspend Immigration to U.S.,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Monday evening that he intended to close the United States to people trying to immigrate into the country to live and work, a drastic move that he said would protect American workers from foreign competition once the nation’s economy began to recover from the shutdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak. “In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, “I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!” In recent weeks, the Trump administration has used health concerns to justify aggressively restricting immigration. Even before the tweet, it had expanded travel restrictions, slowed visa processing and moved to swiftly bar asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants from entering the country, alarming immigration advocates who have said that Mr. Trump and his advisers are using a pandemic to further hard-line immigration policies. But the president’s late-night announcement on Monday signals his most wide-ranging attempt yet to seal off the country from the rest of the world. A formal order temporarily barring the provision of new green cards and work visas could come as early as the next few days, according to several people familiar with the plan. Under such an executive order, the Trump administration would no longer approve any applications from foreigners to live and work in the United States for an undetermined period of time, effectively shutting down the legal immigration system in the same way the president has long advocated closing the borders to illegal immigration. It was not immediately clear what legal basis Mr. Trump would claim to justify shutting down most immigration. Workers who have for years received visas to perform specialized jobs in the United States would also be denied permission to arrive, though some workers in some industries deemed critical could be exempted from the ban, the people familiar with the president’s discussion said. The number of visas issued to foreigners abroad looking to immigrate to the United States has declined by about 25 percent, to 462,422 in the 2019 fiscal year from 617,752 in 2016. Several people familiar with the president’s plans said the Department of Homeland Security was separately weighing a large expansion of travel restrictions that already prohibited travelers from Europe and China. The restrictions would significantly shrink the number of people able to come to the United States for short-term visits. Mr. Trump and his advisers have argued inside the White House that doing more to bar people from other countries from coming into the United States, either for short-term visits or to live and work in the country for longer periods, could help limit the number of infected people who arrive from potential coronavirus hot spots around the world. And they argue that it could relieve pressure on the American health care system. But Mr. Trump’s primary focus appears to be on protecting American workers as the virus ravages what had been a rapidly growing job market. Even before the pandemic, the president and some of his most hard-line advisers had been eager to reduce legal immigration, arguing that Mr. Trump’s “America First” campaign pledge should be seen as protecting native-born Americans from having to compete with foreign workers. Stephen Miller, the architect of the president’s immigration agenda, has pushed repeatedly for regulations and executive actions that would limit the immigration allowed each year, arguing that immigrants are a drain on American society, drive down wages and take jobs from native-born Americans. And the president’s restrictionist allies on Capitol Hill quickly praised word of his actions. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said on Twitter: “22 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last month because of the China virus. Let’s help them get back to work before we import more foreigners to compete for their jobs.” Immigrant rights groups angrily dispute the claim that immigration is bad for American workers, pointing to research that shows there is little connection between immigration and wages, and stressing the benefits of America’s immigrant culture. Charanya Krishnaswami, the advocacy director for the Americas at Amnesty International USA, responded to the president’s tweet with one of her own. “When you’re a xenophobe, bans on migration are the only tired, failed, hateful solution you can think of,” Ms. Krishnaswami wrote. “Suspending immigration won’t make the US — which currently leads among COVID cases worldwide — safe. Our policies need to be grounded in public health, not bigotry.” Mr. Trump’s denigration of migrants was the centerpiece of his 2016 presidential campaign, and his assault on the nation’s immigration system was a defining feature of his first term in office. As he seeks re-election to a second term, Mr. Trump has made clear that he intends to energize his supporters by continuing to stoke a fear of immigrants. In the past several months, Mr. Trump has justified sealing the United States to migrants by highlighting the risk of spreading the coronavirus, even as his administration has been widely criticized for not taking precautions this year to prevent an outbreak. At the end of January, Mr. Trump blocked some travel from China, citing concerns about the spread of the virus. He later extended travel restrictions to most of Europe. Mr. Trump used authority granted to his surgeon general to immediately turn back migrants and asylum seekers to their home countries, even though the Supreme Court refused to allow a similar policy in 2018. His administration has leaned into the policy, even rapidly turning away children who cross the border alone. Weeks later, Mr. Trump ordered the State Department to issue visa sanctions against any country that refused to accept an immigrant the administration wanted to deport. Since taking office, Mr. Trump has carried out some consequential immigration policies. In January, the president expanded his travel restrictions to 13 countries, virtually blocking immigration from Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria. That same month, the Supreme Court allowed the administration to move forward with a wealth test that would deny green cards to immigrants who are thought to be likely to make even occasional and minor use of public benefits like Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers. Many advocates have said the so-called public charge rule has discouraged immigrants from seeking medical assistance at a time when the administration’s top health officials are encouraging Americans to be vigilant for symptoms of the virus. Franita Tolson, who studies constitutional and election law at the University of Southern California, said in an interview that Mr. Trump’s latest tweet continues a well-worn pattern of issuing broad mandates against immigrants, often as a base-pleasing political cudgel, only to later rework the orders under mounting legal pressure. Legally, she said, the administration has a habit of working in reverse: issuing sweeping initiatives, and vetting them afterward. “He tweets out a broad tweet without details, and the administration tailors it to figure out what might pass judicial review,” Ms. Tolson said. She added that Mr. Trump’s latest attempt to issue a restrictive order was sure to meet legal challenges. “Given our infection rate and the lack of testing, he’s taking advantage of a national crisis.” Reached Monday evening, multiple White House officials did not offer information on Mr. Trump’s plans beyond his tweet.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman and Caitlin Dickerson from New York."
"How Abortion, Guns and Church Closings Made Coronavirus a Culture War","This is what it looks like when a pandemic collides with the culture wars in America.The mayor of Louisville, Ky., warned churches that holding services on Easter Sunday would defy the city’s social distancing guidelines. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and Senate majority leader, answered with a stern letter, arguing, “Religious people should not be singled out for disfavored treatment.” The Democratic governor in Michigan extended bans on certain outdoor activities to include using motorboats. Conservatives called her an authoritarian and caricatured her move as a slap at people who enjoy the outdoors. “You can’t go fishing,” a local activist lamented in an interview on “Fox & Friends.” And even though firearms stores remain free to do business in most of the country, the National Rifle Association has a stark message for gun owners. “They want your guns. They want ’em all,” declared the country music legend Charlie Daniels in a promotional video he recorded for the N.R.A. from quarantine at his home in Tennessee. The new patchwork of state and local policies designed to flatten the spread of the coronavirus is inflaming old passions over some of the most contentious issues in politics. Guns, abortion, voting rights and religious expression — concerns that would seem to have little to do with a virus that has likely infected more than a million Americans and killed more than 37,000 — have emerged as fault lines in the debate over how government is responding to the crisis. President Trump does on occasion speak about the importance of social distancing, as he did on Monday, but he is also encouraging discontent, seeing it as a source of raw emotion he can tap as protesters across the country wave “Trump 2020” flags and demand that the country reopen. With messages last week to his Twitter followers to “LIBERATE” states where residents are now under orders to limit their movement — specifically, Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia, all led by Democratic governors — he is feeding what conservatives described as a rising sense of restlessness on the right. “There’s a tremendous amount of social unrest,” said Jeff Landry, the Republican attorney general of Louisiana and an ally of Mr. Trump. “Governors who are using the pandemic as an excuse to keep certain measures in place do so at their own peril.” For now, Mr. Trump is speaking to the minority of Americans who believe the government has gone too far in trying to contain the threat from the virus. And he is doing so by spreading misinformation and innuendo about how the restrictions affect issues like gun ownership and freedom of worship. He falsely claimed last week, for instance, that the Second Amendment was under threat in Virginia. Over the weekend he made unfounded insinuations that Muslims celebrating Ramadan, which begins this week, would not be subject to the same social distancing limitations as Christians were on Easter just over a week ago. “I’ve seen a great disparity in this country,” he said. “They go after Christian churches, but they don’t tend to go after mosques.” So far, a mass uprising seems unlikely. Many of the demonstrations, like one in Denver on Sunday, have drawn only a few hundred people. Larger gatherings, like one at the State Capitol in Lansing, Mich., last week, attracted far-right activists and militia sympathizers, some of whom had semiautomatic rifles slung over their shoulders. The White House’s own current guidelines reflect what most epidemiologists say: Social distancing, limiting personal contact and wearing masks in public are all crucial to keeping the virus in check. Medical experts, including those advising Mr. Trump, have warned that easing these guidelines could lead to a surge in new infections. But some conservatives who support the president’s re-election campaign said they believed that many Americans are growing frustrated with the orders that keep them from socializing, working and worshiping normally. The White House is closely tracking those concerns, and has made Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence available on several conference calls with faith leaders to assure them the administration is listening. And after a Mississippi church was penalized for holding drive-in services in defiance of a local order, Attorney General William P. Barr lent his support, saying that congregants’ First Amendment rights were being infringed. “My sense is that this is a caldron,” said Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and a veteran organizer of the religious right. “It is simply unsustainable to tell people that they have to sit helplessly in their homes watching their businesses go bankrupt, their jobs disappear and their lives destroyed.” Pointing to a recent survey from the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute that found nearly 90 percent of houses of worship in the country were no longer offering services as usual, Mr. Reed said that there were growing questions among religious conservatives, like “why liquor stores and grocery stores can be open, but their churches are closed.” Mr. Reed added that while he thought most people were still willing to stay home, he saw patience fraying. Speaking of Democrats, he said, “If they’re not careful, they will take what they think is going to be a referendum on Donald Trump and turn it into a referendum on the denial of basic freedoms and liberties.” While tensions have flared in the last week, competing political agendas have shaped how leaders approached the enforcement of coronavirus-related restrictions in the past month. Texas, in particular, has been a laboratory for a conservative pandemic response. Like Ohio, Alabama and a few other states with Republican leadership, Texas initially included abortion among the elective medical procedures it said would have to wait until after the immediate threat of the virus had passed. And as the state started ordering the closure of schools and nonessential businesses late last month, the Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, warned abortion providers that they would be “met with the full force of the law” if they did not stop operating. The restriction amounted to “an abuse of power and part of an ongoing effort to use sham justifications to shut down clinics and make an end run around Roe v. Wade,” said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, one of the groups that sued Texas. Clinics remain closed and the governor has said he will leave it up to the courts to decide whether the easing of restrictions on some medical procedures, set to take effect Wednesday, applies to abortions. Four days after his admonition to abortion clinics, Mr. Paxton issued an opinion on an unrelated but equally fraught culture war issue, declaring that emergency stay-at-home orders could not be used to force the closure of firearms stores in the state. The public policy decisions there differ strikingly from states like New York, where Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has declared gun stores to be nonessential businesses. The move prompted a lawsuit from the N.R.A., which is challenging similar actions by lawmakers in New Mexico and California. Conservatives, Mr. Landry said, see these as examples of how “Democrats have basically leveraged this thing to get what they want.” On other issues ranging from property rights to prison policy, Texas has been at the front lines of the escalating clash between left and right. Conservatives have opposed local efforts to prevent second homeowners from going to their properties and to expand access to voting by mail, which is limited to certain populations like older people and those with disabilities. The American Civil Liberties Union sued after Gov. Greg Abbott issued an order preventing the release of some inmates at risk of contracting the virus. Mr. Abbott said releasing “dangerous criminals” put the community at risk because it “slows our ability to respond to the disaster caused by Covid-19.” A state court disagreed and temporarily blocked the governor’s order. The A.C.L.U. has filed more than 30 similar lawsuits across the country. But there are exceptions. Though Republicans in states like Texas and Wisconsin have tried to prevent broader access to alternatives to in-person voting, in Pennsylvania Republicans are supporting it. And in Oklahoma, the Republican governor has approved the release of hundreds of inmates so overcrowded conditions do not contribute to more infections. “The pandemic held out the hope that we could come together and unite and rise above the partisan division that has so long afflicted us, and I think in some instances we are seeing that,” said David Cole, the A.C.L.U.’s national legal director. He added that instances of large church services and gatherings of hundreds of protesters were outliers so far. “Which makes it all the more disturbing,” he added, “that the president of the United States encouraged this kind of activity.” It is not difficult to understand why Mr. Trump feels the impulse to back the demonstrators. Footage of the recent protests shows a significant presence of Trump paraphernalia and an outpouring of support for him. At the Michigan event, which was documented on Facebook by a reporter for The Detroit Free Press, one man waving a Confederate flag explained through his protective mask why he was there. “Trump. Trump all the way,” he said. Others carried the bumblebee yellow Gadsden flag, its coiled snake and “Don’t tread on me” emblem a symbol of the Tea Party, which Mr. Trump has always felt an affinity toward. At the protest outside the Colorado State Capitol on Sunday, one woman who said the shutdowns had gone on too long told The Denver Post, “Pot shops are open, abortion clinics are open and my church is closed.” One man who also attended the protest held a sign that read “Facts not fear,” a variation of the saying that Sean Hannity uses on his radio and Fox News programs — “Facts without fear” — to leave his fans with the false impression that they are getting the truth and nothing but. The people at these protests have been overwhelmingly white. And while the coronavirus can strike people of any race, nationality, religion or political persuasion, data shows it is infecting and killing black people in the United States at disproportionately high rates. Its spread also appears to be worsening in some of the states where the protests have taken place. In Kentucky, where last week demonstrators stood outside the Capitol building in Frankfort and chanted “We want to work!” at the Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, officials reported a sobering development on Monday. The state recorded its highest number of new coronavirus cases yet in a single day: 273."
Dispute Over Virus Testing Delays Deal on Aid to Small Businesses and Hospitals,"WASHINGTON — A dispute between Democrats and the White House over how to handle coronavirus testing emerged on Monday as one of the most significant sticking points as negotiators struggled to finalize a nearly $500 billion bipartisan agreement to replenish a loan program for small businesses and provide more funding for hospitals and testing. Democrats are pushing to include a requirement in the measure, which is likely to include $25 billion for testing, that the Trump administration establish a national testing strategy, a move the president and Republicans have resisted, insisting on leaving those decisions to each state. The impasse hindering the latest round of federal aid to respond to the coronavirus pandemic reflects a broader disagreement over how to handle testing, a crucial element of the government response on which the Trump administration has been roundly criticized for falling short. President Trump and members of his team have boasted repeatedly about the amount of testing available and pressured governors to accelerate testing in their states. Governors have repeatedly appealed for more federal funding and other help — or, in the case of Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland, taken matters into their own hands and negotiated with suppliers on their own to obtain test kits. Democrats argue that a national testing strategy is crucial to combating the spread of the coronavirus and allowing states to plan for eventual reopening. But Republicans, wary of placing the political onus on the administration to devise and implement such a strategy, have argued that states should set their own plans. And Mr. Trump appeared to reject the Democrats’ proposal on Monday, saying that they were “playing a very dangerous political game” by focusing on testing. “States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing,” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. Negotiators were also still haggling over the terms of the new aid for small businesses and hospitals, and a Democratic demand for funds for state and local governments. But despite the disagreements, leaders said a deal was in sight. The bulk of the money would be designated for the Paycheck Protection Program, which was created by the stimulus law approved last month and allows companies that keep paying their employees to receive forgivable loans underwritten by the federal government. Congressional leaders and administration officials negotiated through the day on Monday, and Senate leaders scheduled a session for Tuesday afternoon, signaling optimism that they could resolve the issue and quickly approve the funds without a formal vote that would require senators to return to Washington. “We’re getting closer,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, told reporters on Monday, donning a blue surgical mask as he departed the Capitol. Asked about the holdup, he said, “We’re still in discussions.” Later on Monday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told House Democrats during a conference call that she was hopeful a deal could be reached by the end of the night, according to two people familiar with the private conversation, who spoke about it on condition of anonymity. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, said that he was planning for a vote on Wednesday, but that it could slip to Thursday. “We’re down to the fine print,” Ms. Pelosi said on CNN on Monday evening, adding that she remained “optimistic and hopeful that we’ll come to a conclusion tonight.” Mr. Trump, speaking at a coronavirus task force briefing Monday evening, said that “tremendous progress” had been made, and that he hoped to see a Senate vote Tuesday. But Democrats were continuing to insist on bolstering national testing efforts.“Senate Democrats are fighting for our $30 billion plan for a comprehensive national testing strategy,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said on Twitter. “Because we need major new investments to bolster the supply and manufacturing chain and significantly expand free testing for all, reporting and contact tracing. The $349 billion initially provided for the small business loan program ran out on Thursday after Democrats blocked an effort to approve the administration’s request for $250 billion in new funding. Without the money, banks could no longer offer loans to small businesses, leaving millions of applications in limbo. Mr. McConnell accused Democrats on Monday of “prolonging their discussions with the administration” and delaying a final agreement. “It is past time to get this done for the country,” he said. While talks continued on Monday, lawmakers appeared to be coalescing around providing $310 billion to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program and reserving $60 billion of that for smaller financial institutions; adding $60 billion for the Small Business Administration’s disaster relief fund; and devoting an additional $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing. In addition to a broader testing policy, Democrats were also still pushing to include funds to assist state and local governments. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mr. McConnell told Republican senators in a conference call Sunday afternoon that they would not include additional aid for state and local governments. Mr. Trump told reporters, “That will be in our next negotiation.” Senate leaders are hoping to approve any deal during a procedural session to avoid having lawmakers come back to Washington before their scheduled May 4 return — a maneuver that would require agreement from all 100 senators. Mr. McConnell told reporters that he could not confidently say whether that was feasible until negotiators produced a compromise. Some House Republicans have objected to the prospect of approving another sweeping increase in spending without a roll-call vote, and some Democrats have begun to register objections of their own, arguing that the emerging agreement does not provide enough aid. “It is insulting to think that we can pass such a small amount of money — in the context of not knowing when Congress is even going to reconvene — pass such a small amount of money, pat ourselves on the back and leave town again,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, said on Monday. “I’m not here with the luxury of time,” she added. “I need legislation that is going to save people’s lives.”Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting."
Trump Exceptionalism,"A few weeks ago, as the president received some of the highest marks of his presidency, we wrote about a “Trump bump.” Over the past few weeks, that bump has turned into a fairly distinct slump, as President Trump’s approval ratings returned to where they were before the pandemic began.The president’s job approval rating has slipped 6 percentage points since mid-March, to 43 percent — the sharpest drop Gallup has recorded for the Trump presidency so far, in part because the president’s ratings have remained fairly stable (and lower than the historical average for presidents of 53 percent).In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released on Sunday, just 36 percent said they trusted what the president said about coronavirus, while 52 percent did not. Voters by a 9-point margin said they thought Joe Biden would be better able to handle a crisis than Mr. Trump, and by a 9-point margin said Mr. Biden would be better at responding to the coronavirus.And in a Pew poll, 65 percent of Americans said Mr. Trump was too slow to take major steps to address the threat to the United States when cases of the disease were first reported in other countries.Typically, during a national crisis, leaders get a boost in their numbers, as a result of the rally-around-the-flag moment. That’s been happening both in the U.S. and around the world. Unlike Mr. Trump, leaders in Europe and across the globe have seen their support rise to record highs. Even in Italy, one of the countries hit hardest by the virus, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has hit a remarkable 71 percent approval rating, up 27 points. At home, governors are getting marks far higher than Mr. Trump, with majorities in state polls saying they approve of how their governor is handling the crisis. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has quickly returned to his baseline level of support, which has averaged around 40 percent. The fact that a majority of Americans see his early response to the virus as inadequate suggests that his numbers could decline further if the situation worsens, given that the current situation with the virus can be traced back to the steps taken early on. Conservatives say Mr. Trump could improve his ratings — and his chances at re-election — by swiftly reopening the country. They point to protests happening around the country in which demonstrators storm state capitols and clog streets as a sign that some Americans are growing frustrated by the restrictions and are worried about the economic impact. So far, polling has shown that these protesters represent only a small minority of Americans — or even of all Republicans. But some right-wing activists argue that those numbers are beginning to shift away from backing the most severe restrictions. “The political side is going to start settling out in the next month,” said Adam Brandon, president of FreedomWorks, a conservative group involved with the demonstrations that has been polling on the stay-at-home orders. “In the long run, if the president opens it up in the right way in the next month to six weeks, the American people are going to support that.” Of course, reopening carries serious risks. Public health officials and governors warn that states lack the kind of widespread testing to control the virus. Some of those states may not simply have experienced the height of the pandemic yet, as the disease spreads from heavily Democratic places like New York and California into more rural, Republican states. An even broader flare-up of the disease could quickly turn a slump into stagnation — both for the economy and the president.  Is America ready to reopen? The country is at the start of what’s likely to be a long political fight over when to begin reopening. In California, the stay-at-home order has no end date. In Georgia, Gov.

"Excluded From Bailouts, Mortgage Servicers Face Cash Crunch","WASHINGTON — Federal policymakers have rushed to backstop nearly every corner of the financial system as the coronavirus exacts a bruising toll on the U.S. economy. But there is growing concern that a critical corner of the housing industry has been overlooked, putting mortgage companies in a precarious position as millions of borrowers delay payments. The strain is expected to intensify in the coming weeks, as businesses shed millions of workers who will have little choice but to seek a hardship payment waiver or forbearance from their lenders. That could put a large swath of the mortgage industry in jeopardy, with firms that are not banks but make loans and collect payments facing a severe cash crunch and potential insolvency. Lawmakers in both parties have begun warning about a looming crisis and are urging the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to take swift action. This month, a bipartisan group of senators warned Mr. Mnuchin that $100 billion of mortgage payments could be delayed this year and that standalone mortgage servicers, whose annual net profits they estimated amounted to less than $10 billion combined, could become insolvent. House Democrats have echoed those concerns. “Mortgage servicers are expected to face increased strain as millions of homeowners and renters lose jobs, are furloughed, or see reduced hours, all of which will keep them from making mortgage and rent payments, as a result of this public health crisis,” Representative Maxine Waters, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Senator Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter this week. Yet there is little agreement among policymakers about what, if anything, the government should do to help these firms. Mr. Mnuchin, along with Mark Calabria, the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, have played down the risks to this industry. The Fed has been clear that it is watching, but has yet to signal that it is ready to step in. As a result, a game of chicken has ensued between federal regulators and dozens of mortgage firms that are not affiliated with any bank but play a big role in keeping the $11 trillion residential mortgage market humming. These firms, which both originate mortgages and collect loan payments, have grown after the 2008 housing crisis, as big banks backed away from what was perceived as a risky and expensive business. Today, nonbank mortgage firms, such as Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage and Mr. Cooper (formerly Nationstar), account for nearly 60 percent of all mortgages issued in the United States and service over half of the nation’s outstanding mortgages. It is a cash-intensive business: The servicers collect payments from mortgage borrowers and then funnel it back to the investors who own the bonds backed by those loans. When borrowers are given forbearance and allowed to stop making mortgage payments, the servicer has less cash coming in the door. Yet it is still obligated to make payouts to investors, along with paying property taxes and insurance bills on behalf of property owners. And unlike banks, these firms are not required to have large financial cushions that would allow them to withstand losses. Nearly three million homeowners have already sought forbearance, according to the real estate data firm Black Knight, meaning that 5.5 percent of all mortgage holders asked to delay their monthly payments. The industry expects those numbers to jump in the coming months, especially if unemployment continues to soar as many economists expect. The result could be a cash crisis in May, as many of those principal and interest payments to bond investors come due. “I do think there are going to be financial problems coming because mortgage servicers are going to have trouble, big time,” said Barry Eichengreen, a University of California, Berkeley, economist who is a scholar of the Great Depression. Policymakers have taken significant steps to insulate the financial system and individuals against economic pain, including placing restrictions on foreclosures. A law passed last month allows borrowers with federally backed mortgages — covering the overwhelming majority of home loans — to seek forbearance without penalty for up to a year if they are experiencing financial hardship from the virus. But so far the government has not devised a plan to ensure the financial stability of mortgage servicers. The companies and their lobbyists want a federal lifeline. “They mandated forbearance,” said Michael Bright, chief executive of the Structured Finance Association, a trade group that supports investors in securitized mortgages and other loans. “It would be like telling restaurants they had to prepare food for the unemployed but not paying the restaurants to do so.” The Mortgage Bankers Association has been lobbying for a lending facility.“What we really want is a statement from the Fed and Treasury that they will create such a facility and it will take time to work out operational details but it will be in place when it’s needed,” said Robert D. Broeksmit, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. The risk for servicers has been well-known among regulators, who have routinely cited their shaky business models yet done little to address the vulnerabilities. As recently as December, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, headed by Mr. Mnuchin, warned in its annual report that nonbank mortgage companies “could transmit risk to the financial system should they experience financial stress.” “The largest nonbank servicers have limited liquidity, often just enough cash and securities held for sale to cover a few months of operating and interest expenses.” Some housing regulators began expressing concern in 2016 that nonbank mortgage firms operated with less regulatory oversight than banks and might not be financially equipped to withstand an economic crisis. One regulator, the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, took some steps last year to require nonbank mortgage firms to increase their capital levels and undergo stress tests. Ginnie Mae is an important regulator in the housing market, as it guarantees payments to bond investors on mortgages written by many nonbank firms. Recently, Ginnie Mae took its own steps to quiet concern in the mortgage market by saying it would set up a financing vehicle to provide cash advances to mortgage-servicing firms. But the industry is looking for even broader relief and pressure has been mounting on Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Calabria, whose agency oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two giant government-controlled mortgage finance firms. Mr. Calabria said he was not ready to embrace the “apocalyptic” predictions of mortgage servicers and industry lobbyists. He said he had seen some “insane numbers” predicting that mortgage servicers would need tens of billions of dollars in financial help and said he was skeptical that so many homeowners would seek mortgage relief. Many people are still working from home, he said, and he anticipates some parts of the economy will start to reopen this summer. “Our expectation is the overwhelming majority of people who take forbearance will be for two or three months and not 12 months,” he said. Mr. Calabria set off widespread concern in the mortgage industry two weeks ago, when he said he did not see the need for Fannie and Freddie to provide additional financial support to mortgage servicing firms, and in particular nonbank servicers. He said his job is to make sure Fannie and Freddie — which were placed into a government conservatorship at the start of the last financial crisis — have enough money to avoid financial trouble this time around. Mr. Calabria also said he did not believe the collapse of any one mortgage servicer would pose a systemic risk to the financial system. Mr. Mnuchin, who recently set up a task force on nonbank mortgage liquidity, has tried to allay fears that the United States will leave servicers to fend for themselves. “We’re going to make sure that the market functions properly,” he said at a White House briefing last week. Fed officials, who have taken other steps to ease strain in the mortgage market, have indicated a willingness to consider a mortgage servicer facility. But the institution may be unwilling to put one in place when housing authorities do not want it. “We’re watching carefully the situation with mortgage servicers,” Mr. Powell said at the Brookings Institution on April 9. Mortgages are a “key market” that supports households and consumer spending, he said. If the Fed does do more, it would most likely stem from the $454 billion that Congress gave the Fed and Treasury to stand up emergency lending programs. The Fed has earmarked about 40 percent of those funds for lending and bond-buying that will benefit companies and state and local governments, but has been clear that more could come. But a bailout for the mortgage industry would most likely fuel calls for more regulation.“Policymakers were well aware heading into this crisis that these firms were vulnerable to shocks, but didn’t do anything to improve their resiliency,” said Gregg Gelzinis, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. “We should only bail them out if we simultaneously institute a more stringent regulatory framework for them going forward.”"
Supreme Court Bans Non-Unanimous Jury Verdicts for Serious Crimes,"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that the Constitution banned non-unanimous jury verdicts in cases involving serious crimes. The decision will affect defendants and prisoners in Louisiana and Oregon, the only two states that have allowed such verdicts in recent years. The decision was badly fractured, with the justices sharply debating whether to adhere to an earlier decision. The case concerned Evangelisto Ramos, a Louisiana man who was convicted in 2016 of killing a woman in New Orleans. The jury’s vote was 10 to 2, which was enough under the state’s law at the time. Louisiana has since amended its State Constitution to bar non-unanimous verdicts, but the move came too late to help Mr. Ramos, as it applies only to crimes committed after 2018. Oregon is the last state that allows non-unanimous verdicts in criminal cases.The case, Ramos v. Louisiana, No. 18-5924, was in one sense mere constitutional housekeeping. The Supreme Court has long held that non-unanimous verdicts are forbidden under the Sixth Amendment in federal criminal trials. While the Bill of Rights originally restricted the power of only the federal government, the Supreme Court has ruled that almost all of its protections apply to the states under the 14th Amendment, one of the post-Civil War amendments. It would seem a small step, then, to conclude that the Sixth Amendment bars non-unanimous verdicts in state criminal trials, too. But a confusing 1972 decision, Apodaca v. Oregon, complicated matters. The vote in the case was 4 to 1 to 4, and only Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., who cast the controlling vote, said federal and state cases could be treated differently. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, writing for the majority on Monday, said the Louisiana and Oregon laws were rooted in racism. In 1898, after the Supreme Court ruled that states could not exclude black people from juries, Louisiana held a constitutional convention whose purpose, as the chairman of its judiciary committee put it, was “to establish the supremacy of the white race in this state to the extent to which it could be legally and constitutionally done.” The State Constitution adopted at that convention replaced a unanimity requirement with one that said the votes of nine jurors out of 12 were enough to convict defendants of noncapital felonies. The point, Justice Gorsuch wrote, quoting an earlier decision, was “to ensure that African-American juror service would be meaningless.” (In 1973, the Constitution was amended to require 10 jurors to agree.) “Courts in both Louisiana and Oregon have frankly acknowledged that race was a motivating factor in the adoption of their states’ respective non-unanimity rules,” Justice Gorsuch wrote. In dissent, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and, for the most part, Justice Elena Kagan, said the majority’s discussion of race was part of a trend in “too much public discourse today” that “attempts to discredit an argument not by proving that it is unsound but by attacking the character or motives of the argument’s proponents.” Justice Alito wrote that the Apodaca decision deserved respect and that overruling it would lead to “a potential tsunami of litigation.” In Oregon alone, he wrote, more than 1,000 defendants with pending appeals may be able to challenge their convictions, to say nothing of post-conviction challenges that may be available in both Louisiana and Oregon. Justice Gorsuch said that burden, whatever its magnitude, was not a good enough reason to keep the Louisiana and Oregon laws in place. “The dissent would have us discard a Sixth Amendment right in perpetuity rather than ask two states to retry a slice of their prior criminal cases,” he wrote. “Whether that slice turns out to be large or small, it cannot outweigh the interest we all share in the preservation of our constitutionally promised liberties.” The clashing opinions were mostly a debate over respect for precedent, a topic that has recently consumed and divided the justices as they prepare to confront a potential case on the fate of the constitutional right to abortion established in 1973 in Roe v. Wade. The upshot was a remarkably tangled set of opinions. As summarized by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh in a concurring opinion, it appeared that “six justices treat the result on Apodaca as a precedent” and “a different group of six justices concludes that Apodaca should be and is overruled.” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer joined all of Justice Gorsuch’s opinion, including a passage that said the Apodaca decision was not entitled to be treated as precedent. In addition to Justice Kavanaugh, Justices Clarence Thomas and Sonia Sotomayor each filed separate concurring opinions. Justice Thomas wrote that he agreed with Justice Gorsuch’s bottom line but would have applied a different provision of the 14th Amendment to reach the result. Justice Sotomayor wrote that “while overruling precedent must be rare, this court should not shy away from correcting its errors where the right to avoid imprisonment pursuant to unconstitutional procedures hangs in the balance.” Justice Kavanaugh contributed an 18-page concurring opinion in which he set out an extensive analysis of when overruling precedents is appropriate. He said every current member of the court had voted to overrule constitutional precedents, and he listed major decisions that had overruled earlier cases, including ones on school segregation, gay rights and abortion. The Apodaca decision, he wrote, should also be overruled.“Why stick by an erroneous precedent,” he asked, “that is egregiously wrong as a matter of constitutional law, that allows convictions of some who would not be convicted under the proper constitutional rule, and that tolerates and reinforces a practice that is thoroughly racist in its origins and has continuing racially discriminatory effects?”"
"Frustrated by Lack of Coronavirus Tests, Maryland Got 500,000 From South Korea","When President Trump told governors that they needed to step up their efforts to secure medical supplies, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland took the entreaty seriously and negotiated with suppliers in South Korea to obtain coronavirus test kits. “The No. 1 problem facing us is lack of testing,” said Mr. Hogan, a Republican, who has been among the many critics of the Trump administration’s repeated claims that states have adequate testing provided by the federal government. “We can’t open up our states without ramping up testing.” In recent days, his wife, Yumi Hogan, a Korean immigrant who speaks fluent Korean, had been on the phone in the middle of the night helping to secure the final deal with two labs to sell Maryland the tests. “Luckily we had a very strong relationship with Korea,” Mr. Hogan said. “But it should not have been this difficult.” On Saturday, a Korean Air flight arrived at Baltimore-Washington International Airport carrying 5,000 test kits, which officials said would give the state the ability to make 500,000 new tests. The Food and Drug Administration and other agencies gave their seal of approval for the kits as the plane was landing. “I was frosted because my team was saying that the F.D.A. approval was going to hold it up,” Mr. Hogan said in a telephone interview. “I didn’t care and was going to get the tests anyway.” So far, Maryland has conducted 71,577 tests for the virus, and nearly 14,000 infections have been recorded, a number that continues to rise. More than 500 people have died in the state. A number of South Korean vendors were considered for the new test kits, and ultimately the state went with LabGenomics. Mr. Hogan, Ms. Hogan and a group of state officials greeted the flight to receive the kits on Saturday. The new tests, once they have passed muster in two local labs, will be distributed to the testing centers the state has set up in sporting fields, repurposed vehicle emissions testing centers and other locations. “We want to get to the point where we can test as many people as possible,” Mr. Hogan said, noting that the state, like most others, has been limited to testing only the very sick and emergency and health care workers. Expanded testing capacity will go to high-priority areas, such as nursing and group homes, expanded drive-through sites, primary care practices and urgent care centers. Other states, desperate for things like personal protective equipment and other medical gears, have moved to acquire it, often stealthily, from other nations. On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence said there was “a sufficient capacity of testing across the country today for any state in America” to help the nation emerge from the coronavirus shutdown, something that Mr. Hogan and other governors from both parties disputed."
On Politics: Help for Small Businesses,"Good morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists. Where things standCongress and the White House are nearing a deal on major stopgap legislation that would put $300 billion into a depleted loan program for small businesses hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The bill is also set to include money for hospitals and virus testing — a concession to Democrats’ demands that Senate Republicans and the White House had resisted for weeks. President Trump and his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, have approved the bill’s overall framework, and top Democrats appeared on the Sunday morning talk shows to express optimism about a deal. But with the virus preventing in-person voting at the Capitol in Washington, the path to passage could be thorny: Congressional leaders will probably do all they can to avoid having to bring back legislators for a vote. That would require unanimous passage of the bill, so any significant disagreements would have to be worked out in the negotiating phase.As Trump works to evade blame for the virus’s spread, he is receiving plenty of affirmation — and inspiration — from his allies in conservative media and on Twitter. From the beginning of the crisis, pundits on Fox News and talk-radio shows have pushed skepticism of anything virus-related that might seem to hurt the president politically, and as the pandemic spreads, they are flexibly adjusting their arguments and shifting their targets. The young conservative organizer Charlie Kirk has proved a particularly nimble voice, recently tweeting strident criticisms of the World Health Organization, Hunter Biden, voting rights activists and Democrats in general (they “care more about appeasing China than the American people,” he said). Trump thought this all sounded so nice, he retweeted it twice. And thrice. By the time he was done, he had retweeted Kirk 11 times in one evening, by our count. Photo of the day Demonstrators protested Washington State’s stay-home order to slow the coronavirus outbreak in Olympia on Sunday.   What Americans think about sending medical aid to statesAfter New York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced on Sunday that the state’s coronavirus infection rate appeared to be “on a descent,” Trump reveled in this rare dose of cautiously positive news.  During his news conference on Sunday night, the president played a two-minute clip of Cuomo at his own daily briefing, and he gave himself a pat on the back for helping New York expand its hospital capacity.  But Cuomo has also raised alarms about the lack of a national framework for virus testing, repeatedly calling for more federal assistance to ramp up testing. And he is far from the only governor to have raised similar concerns. Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, said on Sunday that the federal government should be doing more to make tests available. But at Sunday’s briefing, Trump pushed back. “They said the same thing with ventilators, and now we have so many that we’re going to be able to send them and help other countries that are in need,” Trump said, dismissing demands for a more robust national testing system. “We’re doing great on testing.” Polling suggests that Americans are not so sure. In a Fox News poll released this month, four in five voters nationwide said they were worried about their state running out of medical supplies, with more than half of those people describing themselves as very concerned. In poll after poll, when it comes to confronting the pandemic, Americans are more likely to give high marks to their state governments than to the White House. But they still think the buck stops with the president. By a factor of nearly two to one, Americans said in a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll that they ultimately considered the handling of the pandemic to be the federal government’s responsibility. Fifty-four percent said in a recent Pew Research Center poll that Trump was not doing a good job of working with state governments. And 55 percent gave him low marks on responding to the needs of hospitals and medical professionals. For Trump, an equally troubling number in that poll has to do with perceptions of his trustworthiness, as he seeks to shift blame for supply shortages away from himself. Respondents to the Pew poll were particularly unlikely to give him good marks on providing the public with reliable information about the pandemic. By a 15-point margin, Americans were more likely to say he was not doing this well. On Politics is also available as a newsletter.

"Trump, Head of Government, Leans Into Antigovernment Message","First he was the self-described “wartime president.” Then he trumpeted the “total” authority of the federal government. But in the past few days, President Trump has nurtured protests against state-issued stay-at-home orders aimed at curtailing the spread of the coronavirus. Hurtling from one position to another is consistent with Mr. Trump’s approach to the presidency over the past three years. Even when external pressures and stresses appear to change the dynamics that the country is facing, Mr. Trump remains unbowed, altering his approach for a day or two, only to return to nursing grievances. Not even the president’s re-election campaign can harness him: His team is often reactive to his moods and whims, trying but not always succeeding in steering him in a particular direction. Now, with Mr. Trump’s poll numbers falling after a rally-around-the-leader bump, he is road-testing a new turn on a familiar theme — veering into messages aimed at appealing to Americans whose lives have been disrupted by the legally enforceable stay-at-home orders. Whether his latest theme will be effective for him is an open question: In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday, just 36 percent of voters said they generally trusted what Mr. Trump says about the coronavirus. But the president, who ran as an insurgent in 2016, is most comfortable raging against the machine of government, even when he is the one running the country. And while the coronavirus is in every state in the union, it is heavily affecting minority and low-income communities. So when Mr. Trump on Friday tweeted “LIBERATE,” his all-capitalized exhortations against strict orders in specific states — including Michigan — were in keeping with how he ran in 2016: saying things that seem contradictory, like pledging to work with governors and then urging people to “liberate” their states, and leaving it to his audiences to hear what they want to hear in his words. For instance, Mr. Trump did not take the opportunity to more forcefully encourage the protesters when he spoke with reporters on Friday. “These are people expressing their views,” Mr. Trump said. “They seem to be very responsible people to me.” But he said he thought the protesters had been treated “rough.” In a webcast with Students for Trump on Friday, a conservative activist and Trump ally, Charlie Kirk, echoed the message, encouraging a “peaceful rebellion against governors” in states like Michigan, according to ABC News. On Fox News, where many of the opinion hosts are aligned with Mr. Trump and which he watches closely, there have also been discussions of such protests. And Mr. Trump has heard from conservative allies who have said they think he is straying from his base of supporters in recent weeks. So far, the protests have been relatively small and scattershot, organized by conservative-leaning groups with some organic attendance. It remains to be seen if they will be durable. But Mr. Trump’s show of affinity for such actions is in keeping with his fomenting of voter anger at the establishment in 2016, a key to his success then — and his fallback position during uncertain moments ever since. In the case of the state-issued orders, Mr. Trump’s advisers say his criticism of certain places is appropriate. Stephen Moore, a former adviser to Mr. Trump and an economist with FreedomWorks, an organization that promotes limited government, said he thought protesters ought to be wearing masks and protecting themselves. But, he added, “the people who are doing the protest, for the most part, these are the ‘deplorables,’ they’re largely Trump supporters, but not only Trump supporters.” On Sunday, Mr. Trump again praised the protesters. “I have never seen so many American flags,” he said. But Mr. Trump’s advisers are divided about the wisdom of encouraging the protests. At some of them, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, a Democrat, has been compared to Adolf Hitler. At least one protester had a sign featuring a swastika. One adviser said privately that if someone were to be injured at the protests — or if anyone contracted the coronavirus at large events where people were not wearing masks — there would be potential political risk for the president. But two other people close to the president, who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly, said they thought the protests could be politically helpful to Mr. Trump, while acknowledging there might be public health risks. One of those people said that in much of the country, where the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths are not as high as in places like New York, New Jersey, California and Washington State, anger is growing over the economic losses that have come with the stringent social-distancing restrictions. And some states are already preparing to restart their economies. Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, took early actions against the spread of the virus, is planning a staged reopening beginning on May 1. Still, as Mr. Trump did throughout 2016, as when he said “torture works” and then walked back that statement a short time later, or when he advocated bombing the Middle East while denouncing lengthy foreign engagements, he has long taken various sides of the same issue. Mobilizing anger and mistrust toward the government was a crucial factor for Mr. Trump in the last presidential election. And for many months he has been looking for ways to contrast himself with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and a Washington lifer. The problem? Mr. Trump is now president, and disowning responsibility for his administration’s slow and problem-plagued response to the coronavirus could prove difficult. And protests can be an unpredictable factor, particularly at a moment of economic unrest. Vice President Mike Pence, asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” about the president’s tweets urging people to “liberate” states, demurred. “The American people know that no one in America wants to reopen this country more than President Donald Trump,” Mr. Pence said, “and on Thursday the president directed us to lay out guidelines for when and how states could responsibly do that.” “And in the president’s tweets and public statements, I can assure you, he’s going to continue to encourage governors to find ways to safely and responsibly let America go back to work,” he said. With the political campaign halted, Mr. Trump’s advisers have seen an advantage in the frozen-in-time state of the race. Mr. Biden has struggled to fund-raise or even to get daily attention in the news cycle. But Mr. Trump himself has seemed at sea, according to people close to him, uncertain of how to proceed. His approval numbers in his campaign polling have settled back to a level consistent with that before the coronavirus, according to multiple people familiar with the data. His campaign polling has shown that focusing on criticizing China, in contrast with Mr. Biden, moves voters toward Mr. Trump, according to a Republican who has seen it. “Trump finally fired the first shot” with his more aggressive stance toward the Chinese government and its leader, Xi Jinping, said Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist. “Xi is put on notice that the death, economic carnage and agony is his and his alone,” Mr. Bannon said. “Only question now: What is America’s president prepared to do about it?” Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, has advocated messages that contrast Mr. Trump with Mr. Biden on a number of fronts, including China. But inside and outside the White House, other advisers to Mr. Trump see an advantage in focusing attention on the presidency. Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, has argued in West Wing discussions that there is a time to focus on China, but that for now, the president should embrace commander-in-chief moments amid the crisis. Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey and a friend of Mr. Trump’s, said on ABC’s “This Week” that he did not think ads criticizing Mr. Biden on China were the right approach for now. Ultimately, Mr. Trump’s advisers said, most of his team is aware that it can try to drive down Mr. Biden’s poll numbers, but that no matter what tactics it deploys now, the president’s future will most likely depend on whether the economy is improving in the fall and whether the virus’s spread has been mitigated. Those things will remain unknown for months. “This is going to be a referendum,” Mr. Christie said, “on whether people think, when we get to October, whether or not he handled this crisis in a way that helped the American people, protected lives and moved us forward.”"
White House and Democrats Near Deal on Aid for Small Businesses,"WASHINGTON — The White House and congressional Democrats on Sunday closed in on an agreement for a $450 billion economic relief package to replenish a depleted emergency fund for small businesses and to expand coronavirus testing around the country, with votes on the measure possible early this week. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin described the broad outlines of the package in an appearance on CNN on Sunday. The agreement would include $300 billion to replenish the emergency fund, called the Paycheck Protection Program; $50 billion for the Small Business Administration’s disaster relief fund; $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said in separate television appearances Sunday morning that a deal appeared to be in the offing. “We’ve made very good progress, and I’m very hopeful we could come to an agreement tonight or early tomorrow morning,” Mr. Schumer said, appearing shortly after Mr. Mnuchin on CNN’s “State of the Union.” He said the White House was “going along with” some of the Democrats’ requests, “so we feel pretty good.” Mr. Mnuchin said President Trump approved of the framework, and the president himself expressed optimism on Sunday night about an agreement. “We are very close to a deal,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Mnuchin said he hoped that the Senate could vote on the bill as early as Monday and the House on Tuesday. That would represent a significant breakthrough after nearly two weeks of stalemate over the bill, even as the $349 billion small-business fund ran dry Thursday with many applicants still in line, a move that risked adding more bankruptcies, business failures and job losses to an already stunning economic toll. That timeline, however, could be optimistic, and the path ahead is complicated. With lawmakers scattered across the country, many in states that are restricting travel, House and Senate leaders will most likely try to approve any agreement during procedural sessions this week as opposed to bringing their rank and file back to the Capitol to vote. But during procedural sessions, any one lawmaker could object, delaying final passage. The money for hospitals and testing in the package Mr. Mnuchin outlined was a significant concession to Democrats, who were standing in the way of a quick and stand-alone infusion of cash to the Paycheck Protection Program, which offers forgivable loans to small businesses to create incentives for them to keep employees on their payroll. Democrats had also wanted to couple an infusion for the small-business program with more money for states and cities. But Mr. Mnuchin said such funds would be included in a future relief package. Later on Sunday, Senators Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, and Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, announced what they described as “a major bipartisan breakthrough” to deliver funds to states and communities on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus. Their proposal would make counties and towns with 50,000 or more people eligible for federal dollars; the current population threshold is 500,000. The senators said they would introduce the plan when the Senate convened. “Senator Menendez’s state and mine were hit hard by the Covid-19 epidemic,” Dr. Cassidy, a gastroenterologist, said in a statement, adding that the two “worked hard to make sure state and local governments can maintain essential services necessary for employees and employers to survive.” That bipartisan effort stood in stark contrast to the partisan warfare that has enveloped the talks over the small-business aid since the start. On Sunday, Mr. Trump attacked Ms. Pelosi on Twitter as “an inherently ‘dumb’ person” and predicted that she would be “overthrown” as speaker, “either by inside or out.” That capped a week that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill spent trading barbs. Republicans, who argued that there was no need to add money for hospitals and testing when it had not yet run out, accused Democrats of holding small businesses hostage while unemployment numbers soared. “I cannot understand after watching another five million get unemployed how Speaker Pelosi continues to say no,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, said Thursday morning on a conference call with reporters. Republicans have also expressed strong opposition to adding money for states and municipalities, saying Democrats have pushed for unrestricted funds, not related to the coronavirus, that would effectively subsidize bad fiscal decisions that occurred before the pandemic. That has been a red line for Republicans throughout the talks. But after the funding for the Paycheck Protection Program lapsed, Republicans expressed the first hints of openness to accepting at least some of the Democrats’ demands. In an interview with Politico on Friday, Mr. McCarthy said he was “fine with doing some hospital” funding as part of a package to shore up the program. Some Republicans, though, have expressed skepticism about Mr. Mnuchin, whom they see as accommodating to Democrats. Asked on Thursday about how a deal that included hospital money would be received, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, remained noncommittal, saying only, “We’d take a look at it.” Mr. Mnuchin also said on Sunday that he was hopeful that the economy could rebound in a matter of months rather than years. He said that he hoped the extraordinary efforts the government had taken to encourage businesses to keep workers on their payrolls would prevent the jobless rate from reaching 20 percent. Mr. McConnell hosted a call on Sunday with Mr. Mnuchin, Mr. Trump, Republican senators and Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, about the ongoing negotiations. Mr. McConnell said that additional funds for state and local governments, as well as more money for food assistance, would not be included in the final package, according to an aide for a Republican leader who requested anonymity to disclose details of a private phone call. Mr. Mnuchin added that some of the unresolved items were related to funding for testing, and that he would be conferring with Mr. McConnell, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate health committee, and Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, to resolve the issues to ensure swift passage. Democrats are calling the current package Stimulus 3.5, in reference to the three bills that came before it. In the House, Ms. Pelosi and her committee leaders are already working on elements of a fourth package, though it is unclear what that will look like. Once negotiations on the current bill draw to a close, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. McConnell will have to figure out a schedule for voting. One possibility is that the measure could be approved by voice vote, which would spare members the necessity of returning to the Capitol. But a single lawmaker could stand in the way of such a maneuver, which is what happened last month when the House took up the $2 trillion stimulus package that created the paycheck program. Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky, thwarted the effort by demanding a quorum and insisting his colleagues show up in person. Anticipating a repeat of that episode, Ms. Pelosi said last week that she would back a system of remote voting by proxy — a major shift for the speaker, and one that would break with centuries of tradition of voting in person. To do so would require a change in House rules, which itself would require an in-person vote. Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and the chairman of the Rules Committee, who has been deputized by Ms. Pelosi to examine alternative methods of voting, proposed the proxy voting plan last week. It would allow lawmakers who could not travel to the Capitol because of the pandemic to give explicit instructions on each vote to a colleague who would be authorized to act on their behalf. In an appearance on “Fox News Sunday,” Ms. Pelosi said she wanted to know what Republicans thought before moving ahead with the plan. “We want to keep the faith on both sides,” she said. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Massie said — somewhat surprisingly — that he would not object to forgoing a floor vote on changing rules to permit proxy voting so long as the process was sufficiently “transparent.” Mr. Massie said the rule should require that the names of those who voted in person and who voted by proxy be made public, along with the names of those whom absent lawmakers had authorized to vote on their behalf.Emily Cochrane contributed reporting."
"Schools Transform Into ‘Relief’ Kitchens, but Federal Aid Fails to Keep Up","BALTIMORE — On the first day of the coronavirus school closure at Sinclair Lane Elementary School, Janet Bailey, the cafeteria manager, showed up to the school’s kitchen like any other day, ready to do her job. She began fixing the favorites of the 250 or so children who relied on her to feed them daily — chicken patties, a fruit and vegetable, and flavored milk. On the second day, Ms. Bailey realized that she had answered a calling. By the time the building in northeast Baltimore had opened at 10 a.m., there was a line. Among the first was a man who said he only had a half a loaf of bread in the refrigerator. “I just packed him up, no questions asked,” said Ms. Bailey, one of dozens of food service workers who signed up to staff meal sites around the city. “I didn’t know his situation, if he had four kids at home or not, like he said. But I know he was hungry. We are supposed to be here to meet the needs of the community. How could I say no?” After the coronavirus shut down America’s education system, districts fortified their school meals programs to ensure that their most needy students would stay fed. One month in, school leaders realize the federal programs set up to subsidize the meals of tens of millions of students cannot meet the demands of an emergency that has turned their cafeterias into food banks and community kitchens. Several districts are now feeding adults and sending days’ worth of food home for entire families. And they are doing so at a cost that under federal rules they will not recoup, and at a rate that is financially unsustainable. Under the child nutrition programs run by the Department of Agriculture, districts are partially reimbursed for each meal served to their poorest students. But districts are incurring costs that do not qualify, for adult meals, additional equipment and extra pay for food service workers who are risking their safety. The nation’s 12 largest school districts will spend $12 million to $19 million through June 30 to meet the demands of their pandemic meals operations, estimated Katie Wilson, executive director of the Urban School Food Alliance, whose members include large urban districts in Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York and Chicago. The organization is pleading for relief from Congress, the Agriculture Department and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Meantime, the organization has set a donation page to help districts cover costs. “Every one of these schools that has their doors open are literally heroes on the front line,” Ms. Wilson said. “Food workers are now first responders.” Collectively, the districts in the alliance serve 3.6 million students and 635 million meals annually. But in weekly calls since the pandemic started, the districts have reported that nothing had prepared them for the demand they have seen. Families are traveling to their meal sites from neighboring jurisdictions. Residents are showing up from senior living communities. Some families became known as “trick-or-treaters,” hitting up different sites throughout the district. “If people are in need, we’re going to address the need, end of discussion,” Austin Beutner, the superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified School District, said in an interview. “Our inclination is to do the right thing.” Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest school system, is serving between 400,000 and 500,000 meals a day since its schools closed, and will serve its 10 millionth meal this week. About 30 percent of those meals are going to family and community members, so they will not be reimbursed. The district has had to purchase 18 refrigerated trucks to store food and milk, which will cost more than $95,000 over the next three months. “This is not a school meal program,” Mr. Beutner said. “It’s a relief effort.”The nation’s largest school district, in New York City, will serve anyone who needs food, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced this month, a decision that drew some pushback from food service employees who lacked protective gear. The New York City Department of Education said that it was serving about 250,000 meals a day, and had served about four million meals since its schools closed. Any student meals that are not partially reimbursed by the federal government will be funded by the city’s budget. Since the shutdown, the Agriculture Department has loosened rules to allow schools to serve meals outside group settings, and states to serve after-school snacks and meals without an educational activity. It is also allowing parents to pick up meals without their children. A spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department said it was aware that “some schools are opting to allow adults to buy meals for themselves or providing them with meals.” But she said those meals would not be reimbursed. Needy adults, she said, should be turning to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, which the administration has moved to cut with three separate rule changes. “For schools that are closed, we are doing our very best to make sure kids are fed,” Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said. “Local school nutrition professionals know how best to feed their children, and we are working with them and their community partners.” Regulatory hurdles persist. In areas where fewer than half the children were eligible for free or reduced-price meals, school meal providers at first were still having to verify that each child was low-income. The department has since relaxed its rules to allow states to serve students who may not qualify for the program during the school year. But state rules vary. In Mississippi, some school sites with fewer than 40 percent of students eligible for reduced price meals still must justify giving out food. Massachusetts got statewide approval to waive proof of income. “We are hoping for a nationwide waiver because those waivers are not consistent across states,” said Crystal W. FitzSimons, the director of school programs at the Food Research and Action Center. Arne Duncan, a former education secretary who has been helping school superintendents through the crisis, said any government response short of enabling schools to become full-blown food distribution centers was insufficient. “We can’t be constrained by rules and regulations that make no sense now,” said Mr. Duncan, who is now a managing partner at the philanthropic organization Emerson Collective. “All we need is some compassion, common sense and flexibility.” Some schools are partnering with community food banks — many of which are also struggling to keep up — Y.M.C.A.s, and Boys and Girls Clubs to get meals out. All the while, many school districts still lack essential personal protective equipment. In March, districts in California, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia had to suspend or adjust their meals program because employees contracted the coronavirus or feared they would. In early April, a food service worker in Clark County, Nev., the nation’s fifth-largest school district, died from Covid-19. School districts are already beginning to talk about financial challenges for the next school year, said Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokeswoman for the School Nutrition Association. By then, many will have little inventory and insufficient revenue to purchase more. “I’m not sure schools can sustain the same level of outreach,” said Lisa Davis, the senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry campaign at Share Our Strength, a nonprofit organization working to end childhood hunger. In Baltimore, the school district has served more than 25,000 meals to adults, at a cost of $85,000 and counting. Ms. Bailey can rattle off her daily tallies as easily as her phone number. “688 today — 108 adults for breakfast, 108 adults for lunch,” she said with a tinge of disappointment. That was fewer than her average of 800, but thunderstorms had blown through that day. Even though the site opens at 10 a.m., Ms. Bailey adjusted her staff’s schedules to prepare for those who show up as early as 9:30, and for the stragglers who run up with panicked looks a few minutes after it closes at 2 p.m. She knows mothers and fathers by name, which children are lactose intolerant, and who among the vegetarians need peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. She’s become resourceful: When the local food bank recently dropped off a box of 40 meals, she unpacked it and stretched them into 80. “You hear the stories about the health care workers — well, we’re on the front lines, too,” she said. “We’re on our feet from the time we come in the door to the time we leave. We’re doing something that’s bigger than what we can imagine right now.” The district recently switched to cold meals in April to make it easier and safer for families to “grab ’n’ go.” On a recent sunny Tuesday, city residents walked up in their house slippers and drove up in luxury S.U.V.s. There were unaccompanied children, and older residents with handicap parking placards. The only question asked was, “Chicken salad or deli?”“I always tell them, thank you for your service because it’s well appreciated,” said Al Peterson, 62, who picked up meals for three children and two adults. “I get an extra one to take to my homeless guy down the street, too.” Tia Gardner, the owner of My Village Learning Center, a day care in northeast Baltimore, said the free meals were allowing her to stay open. She is taking care of 24 children, all of essential employees, like health care workers. That is down from 62. “Food is one of our biggest budget items,” Ms. Gardner said. “If I’m able to stay open, it eases the minds of parents who still have to go to work.” On Friday, Sinclair Lane Elementary closed out its busiest week to date — 4,056 meals served, 1,307 of them to adults. Ms. Bailey said she hoped that the federal government would step up, but regardless, “as long as the people are coming,” she said, “we’ll be serving.”"
"‘People Would Be So Receptive Right Now, and We Can’t Knock on Doors.’","Brenda Francis settled into the Kingdom Hall in Calhoun, Ga., in mid-March, surrounded by dozens of familiar faces. Signs cautioning against shaking hands and hugging were posted around the room. It felt weird to her but was certainly understandable with the threat of an outbreak looming. She herself already had stocked up on some masks and gloves. When it came time for members to comment on the Bible readings, Ms. Francis noticed the microphones typically passed around the room were now attached to the end of long poles. That was the moment Ms. Francis, a 69-year-old widow living in a small, semirural community in the South, realized just how dramatically the coronavirus pandemic was about to reshape her spiritual life, more than anything ever had in the 47 years since she was baptized as a Jehovah’s Witness. A few days after the boom mics came out in the Kingdom Hall, word came down from the group’s headquarters that, in the interest of safety, Jehovah’s Witnesses should stop witnessing, its practice of in-person attempts at converting people to the group. “People would be so receptive right now,” she said of her ministry, “and we can’t knock on doors.”Across America, most religious groups have stopped coming together in large numbers to pray and hold services, in keeping with stay-at-home orders. They have improvised with online preaching and even drive-in services held as parishioners sit in cars. Mormons have stopped going door-to-door in the U.S. and called home many missionaries working abroad. Jehovah’s Witnesses — with 1.3 million members in the U.S. who hand out brochures on sidewalks and subway platforms and ring doorbells — are one of the most visible religious groups in the nation. Members are called on to share scriptures in person with nonmembers, warning of an imminent Armageddon and hoping to baptize them with the prospect of living forever. The decision to stop their ministries was the first of its kind in the nearly 150 years the group has existed. It followed anguished discussions at Watchtower headquarters, with leaders deciding March 20 that knocking on doors would leave the impression that members were disregarding the safety of those they hoped to convert. “This was not an easy decision for anybody,” said Robert Hendriks, the group’s U.S. spokesman. “As you know, our ministry is our life.” It was for Ms. Francis, who became a Jehovah’s Witness when she was in her 20s with a newborn, and a member knocked on her door in Tennessee and convinced her to attend a Kingdom Hall meeting. She converted. Her family was angry that she no longer came to holiday gatherings; the group doesn’t believe in celebrating holidays or birthdays. Jehovah’s Witnesses became her new family. The more she studied the Bible, the more she came to believe it led to eternal life. She needed to spread the word. Showing up cold on someone’s doorstep didn’t come naturally. She was so shy that once, she recalled, her high school principal — “this huge Goliath guy” — stood on her foot in a crowded hallway and she didn’t say a word, but waited in pain for him to move. She had considered a career going door-to-door as a Mason Shoes saleswoman, but after receiving a catalog, she never mustered the courage to even try to make a sale. To her, witnessing was different. Her faith had helped her stop smoking. It gave her meaning. She had seen people clean up their lives after attending meetings at Kingdom Hall. “By the time I did go to doors, I was so convinced this was the right thing to do that I had no nervousness,” Ms. Francis said. Through the years, she learned to build her pitch around a theme — a Bible verse or a current event — and tried not to sound rehearsed. “You don’t want to sound like a robot,” she said. “You work from the heart. You want enthusiasm.”Early this year, Ms. Francis had been seeing reports on Facebook about the virus sweeping through Wuhan, China. The host of a show she watched on YouTube, Peak Prosperity, had been warning the outbreak could spread internationally. She bought masks and face shields, just in case. She started using plastic grocery bags to cover the gas pump handle when she filled up her tank. By early March, the virus still hadn’t hit Gordon County, where Ms. Francis lives. But the possibility was weighing on her mind. The message on her favorite YouTube show was getting more dire as the host, Chris Martenson, a financial guru-turned-pandemic early warner, ratcheted up his pleadings for viewers to prepare themselves. Ms. Francis’s 27-year-old granddaughter has a compromised immune system. As a senior citizen, she herself was vulnerable. She did what she always has done and channeled her own feelings into her door-knocking ministry. Do you think, she would ask people as she car-pooled with other members to canvass the county, that the virus is a sign of the end of the world? “No one was paying much attention,” she said.Elsewhere, in places like New York where infections were starting to climb, Jehovah’s Witness members were feeling the pinch on their ministries. One of them, Joe Babsky, for weeks had been easing into conversations with members of his Planet Fitness gym in the Bronx. He knew them by first name only — Jerry who had lost more than 100 pounds; Jason who seemed to spend an hour on each body part; Bernie, a 78-year-old who was more fit than men half his age. Mr. Babsky had shown a few of them Bible verses and had made progress recently with Bernie discussing the logic behind the existence of an intelligent creator. Then the gym closed.“All those conversations and others were cut short,” Mr. Babsky said.Life continued as normal in Ms. Francis’s town of Calhoun. She was convinced things were about to change but she was too embarrassed to wear a mask — until an encounter in Costco when a passing shopper coughed without covering her mouth. In mid-March, her Kingdom Hall meetings went virtual. Members logged into Zoom to share Bible scriptures. Ms. Francis settled on one that she thought would resonate as she knocked on doors in her neighborhood across the county, which had by then registered a handful of Covid-19 cases. At the doorstep, Ms. Francis would start her pitch by asking people if they could make one thing in the world go away, what would it be? If the answer had to do with the pandemic, she would recite a couple verses from the book of Luke:“There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and from heaven great signs.” All the signs were clear, she would announce. Armageddon was near. Her message finally seemed to be resonating with people. And then Ms. Francis got word to stop knocking on doors.“This has been so much a part of our lives, so it was like, wow,” she said. “I have often envisioned in paradise where going door-to-door would not be a thing because everyone knows God.” This was not paradise.But Ms. Francis was convinced the end of the world was not far away. There were just too many signs, she said. And so she and many other Jehovah’s Witness members were more compelled than ever to witness any way they could. Many began writing letters or making phone calls to anyone whose numbers they managed to collect before the pandemic hit. Masked and gloved, Ms. Francis hands out pamphlets and cards with her phone number on them to fellow shoppers at the grocery store. Last week, she sent a text to a woman in Hawkinsville, Ga., a few miles away, whom she had been contacting from time to time. The woman said her restaurant had to close because of the pandemic and her brother-in-law was sick with the virus. A couple days later he died. Ms. Francis texted scriptures to the woman and told her that soon all the sickness on earth would be over; all sins would be forgiven; paradise was near. The next day she received a written response: “Thank you so much for the information. It was such a comfort.”"
"For Charlie Kirk, Conservative Activist, the Virus Is a Cudgel","WASHINGTON — Shortly before midnight on Friday, and just hours after he had taken to Twitter to encourage Americans to “liberate” three Democratic-governed states from stay-at-home orders, President Trump reopened his Twitter app and went on another brief tear. He retweeted 11 posts by Charlie Kirk, a young right-wing provocateur with ties to the Trump family and a social media presence that attracts far more attention than some mainstream news organizations. The tweets by Mr. Kirk, 26, who runs Turning Point USA, a conservative student group, hit just the right marks for the president. One tweet accused the World Health Organization of covering up the coronavirus outbreak, and upbraided Democrats for opposing the president’s decision to cut the group’s funding. Another claimed Democrats were appeasing Beijing and not doing enough to help Americans left jobless by the pandemic. A few covered some of the president’s longstanding grievances, such as the conviction of Roger Stone and claims of voter fraud. A well-worn conspiracy theory about Hunter Biden’s dealings with China even made an appearance. Never mind that the W.H.O. — which Mr. Kirk called “the Wuhan Health Organization,” after the city where the pandemic began — issued warnings about the virus early and often, and that a number of the other tweets similarly misconstrued facts. Mr. Kirk doesn’t always let facts get in the way of scoring points, and in recent months he has been among the louder voices stoking conservative skepticism of the threat posed by Covid-19 and using the pandemic as political cudgel. In fact, Mr. Trump first introduced his more than 77 million Twitter followers to the phrase “China Virus” in a retweet of a post by Mr. Kirk on March 10 that linked two Trumpian obsessions: China and the border wall. “Now more than ever, we need the wall. With China Virus spreading across the globe, the U.S. stands a chance if we can control our borders,” Mr. Kirk wrote. Mixing, matching and twisting facts, Mr. Kirk has come to exemplify a new breed of political agitator that has flourished since the 2016 election by walking the line between mainstream conservative opinion and outright disinformation. It is a style that often seems modeled on that of Mr. Trump himself. Backed by prominent Republican donors, and with a powerful ally in the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Kirk both amplifies the president’s message and helps shape it. The president, in turn, has boosted Mr. Kirk’s reach, helping him secure a spot in the regular rotation of pundits who appear on mainstream conservative outlets like Fox News and bring his views to an even wider audience. The pandemic has showcased that dynamic, providing Mr. Kirk with ample fodder to stir up fellow conservatives against a full menu of enemies, real and perceived. In his zeal, Mr. Kirk even managed to get himself briefly banned from Twitter in late March, claiming that the drug hydroxychloroquine had proved “100% effective” in treating the virus (it has not), and that Michigan’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, had threatened doctors who tried to use it (she had not). Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, followed suit in his own tweet, directly quoting Mr. Kirk and getting his own account suspended. Being banned from Twitter is a badge of honor among some conservatives, however, and it did little to stop Mr. Kirk, who declined an interview request for this article. Even as the president and his media allies have oscillated between dismissing the alarm over the virus as anti-Trump hysteria and acknowledging the gravity of the threat — with conspiracy theorists like Mike Cernovich calling for a “culture war cease-fire” — Mr. Kirk has remained insistent that the measures taken to stop the spread of the pandemic are more damaging than the virus itself. The vast majority of Americans have heeded the advice of public-health officials to stay away from one another, helping slow the spread of the pandemic. Mr. Kirk has at times been among those voices, warning young people in March to take the virus seriously and not party on beaches. But he has also fed the growing frustration in some quarters with stay-at-home orders. Mr. Kirk was an early and eager voice for reopening the economy, and last week urged on protesters who took to the streets in Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio. He spent the days leading up to Easter arguing that social-distancing prohibitions against church services were part of a Democratic plot against Christianity. “This China Flu event has given state and local secularists in positions of authority the opportunity they have been waiting for,” he wrote in an essay for Newsweek, where he is a contributor. China has remained a target for Mr. Kirk. He has echoed the Trump campaign’s attacks on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, saying he is soft on China. Earlier this month, he repeated a baseless conspiracy theory that the authorities in Wuhan were burning patients. “THIS is what the American media is defending,” he wrote on Twitter, exhorting his followers to repost his message and “expose the truth!” A Useful FriendshipMr. Kirk has not always been among the believers. As late as the 2016 Republican convention, he was quoted saying that he “was not the world’s biggest Donald Trump fan.” But it was at the convention that Mr. Kirk, like much of the Republican Party, began falling in line. And it was there he first met Donald Trump Jr. Sensing an opportunity, Mr. Kirk offered to help bolster his standing with young conservatives. He then essentially trailed the younger Mr. Trump in the final months of the campaign, ingratiating himself with the family. “I traveled the country for about 70 days straight carrying Donald Trump Jr.’s bags and getting his Diet Cokes,” Mr. Kirk told the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh in February 2019. “Helping book flights and taking pictures and coordinating media, essentially being the youth director of the campaign and also being Don Jr.’s body man.” The relationship has proved mutually beneficial as both men have constructed careers around the idea that left-wing culture has victimized and silenced conservatives. Mr. Kirk has used his Trump connections to raise Turning Point’s profile, and his own. Mr. Trump has used speaking engagements with Turning Point to burnish his own conservative bona fides. The relationship had other benefits, too. Last fall, Turning Point purchased about 2,000 copies of Mr. Trump’s book, “Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us,” helping push it up best-seller lists. The guests on Mr. Kirk’s podcast provide a useful measure of his influence: They have included Mark Meadows, the former congressman and now White House chief of staff, Senator Rick Scott of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and other leading Republicans. His allies credit his ability to tap into anger and frustration felt by conservatives and turn that into messaging. “Charlie has become such an influential figure in conservative politics because he has his finger on the pulse of the right,” said Andy Surabian, an adviser to Donald Trump Jr. A Digital NativeFox News stars like Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson may attract more attention from the political and media establishments. But Mr. Kirk boasts an equally impressive reach, albeit among a far-younger audience — an important political quarry for the president. Some of that reach has been built through Turning Point, which aims to bolster conservative politics on college campuses across the country. Mr. Kirk speaks often at college events; his group has secretly funneled money into student government elections and maintains what it calls a “Professor Watchlist” of teachers who, it alleges, discriminate against conservatives or advance left-wing propaganda. But Mr. Kirk’s combative style truly thrives on social media. In the final two weeks of March, for instance, his Twitter posts about the coronavirus garnered far more “engagements” — a combination of likes, retweets, comments and other interactions — than those of mainstream news organizations like The New York Times and CNN. Conservative outlets like The Daily Caller have not even come close to matching Mr. Kirk’s level of engagement. In that time, Mr. Kirk has argued that Democratic governors are using the coronavirus as an excuse to push for state funding of abortions, and claimed falsely that officials in Portland, Ore., where a handful of businesses were vandalized after the state issued a stay-at-home order, were releasing dangerous inmates from prisons and ordering the police to stop making arrests. “Democrat logic,” he said, was responsible for vandals “smashing windows & destroying businesses.” And then, of course, there was his “China virus” tweet. The phrase had been growing in popularity among some on the right, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, had been consistently referring to Covid-19 as the “Wuhan virus.” But the president had not used the phrase in public until he retweeted Mr. Kirk. Mr. Trump quickly adopted the phrases “China virus” and “Chinese virus,” drawing the ire of critics who said the term promoted xenophobia. In late March, he went so far as to alter a set of prepared remarks, crossing out “coronavirus” and writing “China virus” in thick black Sharpie, though he has since backed off the term. The White House, too, has appeared to join Mr. Trump in taking social media cues from Mr. Kirk. On March 16, Mr. Kirk tweeted a list of diseases named for geographic locations — including the West Nile virus, Ebola and Zika — and wrote, “It’s not xenophobic.” Two days later, the White House came back with a remarkably similar tweet: “Spanish Flu. West Nile Virus. Zika. Ebola. All named for places.” A Turning PointMr. Kirk grew up in Prospect Heights, Ill., a wealthy suburb of Chicago. His family was conservative but not particularly political, Mr. Kirk wrote in his 2016 book “Time for a Turning Point.” His climb to prominence began in April 2012 when, as a high school senior, he wrote a story for Breitbart News arguing that teenagers were being indoctrinated by liberal textbooks. It was hardly a novel idea, but it earned Mr. Kirk an appearance on Fox Business Network and a speaking engagement at a nearby college. There, he was approached by Bill Montgomery, a retired entrepreneur who was impressed by his stage presence. “You can’t go to college!” Mr. Montgomery later recalled telling Mr. Kirk. The pair founded Turning Point the following month. Over the next few years, as Mr. Kirk began making regular appearances on Fox News, Turning Point’s profile grew, attracting tens of millions of dollars from the Republican establishment. Though Turning Point is not required to disclose its financial backers, its roster of heavyweight conservative donors includes Foster Friess, an evangelical Christian businessman who provided the first big injection of cash; the foundation run by Bernard Marcus, co-founder of the Home Depot; and the foundation started by Richard and Helen DeVos, the in-laws of Betsy Devos, the education secretary. Its board members include Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Turning Point has also drawn controversy. A number of staff members have been fired for making racist and anti-Semitic comments, and the group has attracted support from white nationalists. Mr. Kirk has repeatedly insisted that Turning Point does not share their ideology or seek their backing. What he mostly seems to enjoy is mixing it up in all comers, right or left. When white nationalists clashed with counterprotesters after he spoke at the University of Northern Colorado in 2018, Mr. Kirk tweeted, “Why free speech is awesome: these handful of radicals screamed at each other while hundreds of students filled our event!” Some conservative groups have been sharply critical of Turning Point and Mr. Kirk. In March, the Charles Koch Foundation accused Turning Point of “inciting harassment against scholars” after Mr. Kirk tweeted a message encouraging students whose courses were moved online because of the coronavirus to record classes and expose left-wing professors. Yet Mr. Kirk has only become more deeply embedded in the Republican establishment since Mr. Trump’s election. The president is fond of Mr. Kirk, according to current and former administration officials, and one of his tweets on Friday praised Mr. Kirk’s new book, “The MAGA Doctrine.” Last July, Mr. Kirk was invited to participate in a White House social media summit, ostensibly called to discuss the silencing of conservative voices. The guest list consisted mostly of Mr. Trump’s most ardent online supporters and included a number of fringe figures and conspiracy theorists. “I think that’s a positive thing that the president is hearing new ideas and entertaining differences of opinion,” Mr. Kirk said in an interview at the time."
"Paul O’Neill, Treasury Secretary Who Clashed With Bush, Dies at 84","Paul H. O’Neill had just presided over a celebrated revival of the aluminum giant Alcoa and was about to begin his retirement in late 2000 with a long drive across the back roads of America in a new Bentley Flying Spur. Then came calls from Vice President-elect Dick Cheney asking him to become secretary of the Treasury. Despite having a list of reasons for being not right for the job — a key one was that he had grown used to being the boss — Mr. O’Neill agreed. It turned out to be an agonizing tenure.Mr. O’Neill lasted less than two years in the job; his outspoken independence was seen as political disloyalty, and President George W. Bush fired him in December 2002. On Saturday, Mr. O’Neill died at his home in Pittsburgh at 84. His son, Paul Jr., said the cause was lung cancer. Having been handed his walking papers by the White House, Mr. O’Neill rejected the suggestion that he should say publicly that he wanted to return to private life. “I’m too old to begin telling lies now,” he said with typical candor. “If I took that course, people who know me well would say that it wasn’t true. And people who don’t know me well would say, ‘O’Neill was a coward — things aren’t going so well, and he bailed out on the president.’” He promptly became the subject and chief source for a rare book about the inner workings of an administration still in power, “The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O’Neill,” by Ron Suskind, published in 2004. Its contents were considered so politically volatile at a time when Mr. Bush was seeking re-election that the title was withheld until just before publication. Mr. Suskind called the book “an experiment in transparency,” relying on thousands of documents supplied by Mr. O’Neill, who fact-checked the manuscript. Michael Tomasky, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said it showed how “deeply corrupted” traditions of public service had become. The book reached No. 1 on The Times’s best-seller list. Among its allegations was not only that Mr. Bush was often unengaged in policy discussions, but also that many decisions, including the invasion of Iraq, had seemed to have been politically ordained. As Mr. Bush’s first term proceeded early on, the impression grew among outsiders that Mr. O’Neill’s long corporate career had rendered him insensitive to Washington realities and undermined his influence. “People think he was politically tone-deaf,’’ David Aufhauser, the general counsel of the Treasury Department from 2001 to 2004, was quoted as saying in the book. “He wasn’t.” “He knew full well the political consequences,” Mr. Aufhauser said, and he was “fearless” in pressing ideas based on facts and evidence. He cautioned, for example, that Mr. Bush’s tax cuts were ill-advised. In previous government stints, Mr. O’Neill had been involved in matters ranging from tax policy, health care and welfare reform to food stamps, busing and housing. In fact, Mr. O’Neill noted in an interview for this obituary in 2017, his Washington experience had been “more than that of anybody at the table.” That experience included intimate involvement in most of the major domestic controversies of the Nixon years as a high-ranking official at the Budget Bureau. (It was renamed the Office of Management and Budget during his tenure, which included appointment as deputy director.) He and three others at the budget office — Roy L. Ash, Frederic V. Malek and Frank G. Zarb — were reported to have largely run the government in 1974 at a time when President Richard M. Nixon was weakened by the Watergate scandal. “That’s basically correct,” Mr. Zarb, a longtime friend of Mr. O’Neill’s, recalled many years later. Mr. O'Neill, he said, “knew more about government life than most people in government.” Mr. O’Neill acknowledged that he had misjudged the influence he could have in the Bush administration. “I thought I knew the players well enough, and that we were like-minded about fact-based policymaking,” he said. “It turned out that was all wrong.” Paul Henry O’Neill was born on Dec. 4, 1935, in St. Louis into a military family and grew up on bases in the Midwest and West with his two brothers and a sister. His father, John Paul O’Neill, was a master sergeant in the Army Air Forces. His mother was Gaynold (Irving) O’Neill. He attended Anchorage High School in Alaska, where he met Nancy Wolfe. They married in 1955. She survives him, as do his son; three daughters, Patricia Wilcox, Margaret Tatro and Julie Kloo; 12 grandchildren; and 15 great-grandchildren. Mr. O’Neill enrolled at California State University, Fresno, with ambitions to be an engineer but left for a time to take road survey and site engineering jobs in Alaska. When he returned to Cal State, he graduated in three years. It was there, he said, that he “decided that economics was a lot more interesting than engineering.” Changing course, he began a five-year doctoral program in economics at Claremont University College (now Claremont Graduate University) in Claremont, Calif. While there, on a lark, he took an exam for midlevel government jobs, passed it, and wound up at the Veterans Administration (now the Department of Veterans Affairs), where he spent five years as a computer systems analyst. He was later dispatched to Indiana University, where he earned a master’s degree in public administration. He joined the budget office in 1967. There he integrated more than two dozen health-related government programs in rising to deputy director. With a daughter in college, a financially pinched Mr. O’Neill was recruited by the International Paper Company in 1977 to be vice president of strategic planning. To his amazement, he found the company had no systematic knowledge of its strengths and weaknesses; the framework Mr. O’Neill created set him on the path to become president of the company. Probably his biggest career success was at Alcoa, which had suffered after making a series of poor acquisitions before he joined as chief executive in 1987. When he retired in 2000, the company’s revenues had nearly tripled, and its stock that year was the best performer on the New York Stock Exchange. His tenure began with what Mr. Suskind called “management havoc” — discharging many top executives and revamping operations. At the same time, he won praise for improving worker safety and labor relations, increasing productivity and fostering an egalitarian open-door policy with his employees. Mr. O’Neill had been friendly with President George H.W. Bush and, just after joining Alcoa, turned down an offer to become his secretary of defense. Mr. O’Neill later encouraged Mr. Bush to break his pledge not to raise taxes. When Mr. Bush did raise taxes, which proved politically damaging to him, and was rebuked by the United States Chamber of Commerce for the move, Mr. O’Neill pulled Alcoa out of the organization. After he left George W. Bush’s cabinet, Mr. O’Neill served on many boards and returned to the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative, a consortium of hospitals, associations and business that he had helped found in 1997. One of the most unlikely episodes of Mr. O’Neill’s Treasury tenure was his four-nation trip to sub-Saharan Africa in the company of Bono, the lead singer of U2 and anti-poverty activist. “I don’t have time to be a ballerina barre for a rock star,” Mr. O’Neill complained to an aide when Bono first asked for his help. “I’ll give him a half an hour.” But he soon decided that he needed to see what programs worked if he were to support sending more money to Africa, and the pair set off, accompanied by a sizable international media contingent. “Come on, let’s step up for a picture,” he said to Bono at one point in Ghana after they had donned Ghanaian robes and hats. “So what if we never live this down.”Peter Keepnews contributed reporting."
A Key G.O.P. Strategy: Blame China. But Trump Goes Off Message.,"WASHINGTON — The strategy could not be clearer: From the Republican lawmakers blanketing Fox News to new ads from President Trump’s super PAC to the biting criticism on Donald Trump Jr.’s Twitter feed, the G.O.P. is attempting to divert attention from the administration’s heavily criticized response to the coronavirus by pinning the blame on China. With the death toll from the pandemic already surpassing 34,000 Americans and unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Great Depression, Republicans increasingly believe that elevating China as an archenemy culpable for the spread of the virus, and harnessing America’s growing animosity toward Beijing, may be the best way to salvage a difficult election. Republican senators locked in difficult races are preparing commercials condemning China. Conservatives with future presidential ambitions of their own, like Senators Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley, are competing to see who can talk tougher toward the country where the virus first emerged. Party officials are publicly and privately brandishing polling data in hopes Mr. Trump will confront Beijing. Mr. Trump’s own campaign aides have endorsed the strategy, releasing an attack ad last week depicting Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, as soft on China. The ad relied heavily on images of people of Asian descent, including former Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, who is Chinese-American, and it was widely viewed as fanning the flames of xenophobia. “Trump has always been successful when he’s had a bogeyman and China is the perfect bogeyman,” said Chris LaCivita, a longtime Republican strategist. But there is a potential impediment to the G.O.P. plan — the leader of the party himself.Eager to continue trade talks, uneasy about further rattling the markets and hungry to protect his relationship with President Xi Jinping at a moment when the United States is relying on China’s manufacturers for lifesaving medical supplies, Mr. Trump has repeatedly muddied Republican efforts to fault China. Even as the president tries to rebut criticism of his slow response to the outbreak by highlighting his January travel restrictions on China, he has repeatedly called Mr. Xi a friend and said “we are dealing in good faith” with the repressive government. He also dropped his periodic references to the disease as “the China virus” after a telephone call with Mr. Xi. Yet in private, he has vented about the country. Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said he informed Mr. Trump in a Thursday telephone conversation that the meat processing plant in South Dakota suffering a virus outbreak is owned by a Chinese conglomerate. The president responded, “I’m getting tired of China,” according to Mr. Cramer. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Trump’s conflicted messaging on China will hurt him with voters, who have repeatedly seen the president argue both sides of issues without suffering the harm that another politician would. And while Mr. Trump’s team knows that his own words will be used against him, they believe they can contrast his history favorably with that of Mr. Biden. On Tuesday, at his daily briefing, Mr. Trump was candid about the transactional rationale behind his stance toward China. Pressed on how he could criticize the World Health Organization for what he called pushing “China’s misinformation,” after he had also lavished praise on Beijing’s purported transparency, he responded, “Well, I did a trade deal with China, where China is supposed to be spending $250 billion in our country.” “I’d love to have a good relationship with China,” he added.On Friday, however, he posited that China must have the most deaths from the coronavirus — the United States does — and later said, “I’m not happy with China.” He repeated the assertion on Saturday, saying that China had many more deaths than it had reported, and that the virus “could have been stopped in China. Before it started.’’ But he continued to show deference to Mr. Xi, saying “I don’t want to embarrass countries that I like and leaders that I like, but you have to see some of these numbers.” Despite the president’s diverging public statements, a central pillar of his campaign’s approach is to deflect anger over the human casualties and economic pain of the coronavirus onto an adversary that many Americans already view warily. The strategy includes efforts to leverage the U.S.-China relationship against Mr. Biden, who Republicans believe is vulnerable because of his comments last year playing down the geopolitical challenge posed by China and what Republicans claim was high-paying work that his son, Hunter, has done there. (A lawyer for the younger Mr. Biden said he was uncompensated for his work.) Mr. Biden, for his part, has criticized Mr. Trump’s warm words for China. On Friday, his campaign released a video assailing the president for not pressing Mr. Xi to let the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention into his country and for being “more worried about protecting his trade deal with China than he was about the virus.”On a conference call with reporters, Antony J. Blinken, a senior Biden adviser, noted that in January and February “the president praised China and President Xi more than 15 times.” He attributed the flattery to the administration’s not wanting to “risk that China pull back on implementing” the initial trade agreement the two countries signed in January. Candidates of both parties have targeted China in past campaigns. But with the United States entering a presidential election season as the Wuhan-borne contagion spreads across the country, the rhetoric this time is far more pointed — with concern growing that it will fan xenophobia and discrimination against Asian-Americans. It is especially striking to see a primarily internationalist Democratic Party and the traditionally business-friendly G.O.P. attempt to portray the other as captive to Beijing — yet that only illustrates the electoral incentives at play. Mr. Locke, who also served as ambassador to China, said in an interview that there was plainly a “growing anti-China mood in Washington.” He said there would need to be a “post-mortem” on how Beijing handled the coronavirus, but for now argued that Mr. Trump’s own muted concerns about China had helped shield the Chinese government from criticism about its own actions in the early months of the outbreak. Mr. Trump’s clashing comments on China illustrate not only his unreliability as a political messenger but also his longstanding ambivalence over how to approach the world’s second-largest economy. He ran for president four years ago vowing to get tough with China, but his ambition was not to isolate the Chinese but to work with them — and especially for the United States to make more money from the relationship. This goal has prompted him to often lavish flattery on Mr. Xi, most memorably when Mr. Trump rhapsodized about the way they bonded over “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake you’ve ever seen” at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2017. The president’s hopes for securing a major trade agreement with China have been reinforced by a coterie of his advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who have often prevailed in internal battles over White House hard-liners. But with the coronavirus death toll growing and the economy at a standstill, polls show that Americans have never viewed China more negatively. In a recent 17-state survey conducted by Mr. Trump’s campaign, 77 percent of voters agreed that China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, and 79 percent of voters indicated they did not think China had been truthful about the extent of infections and deaths, according to a Republican briefed on the poll. Yet those polling numbers also come as 65 percent of Americans say they believe that Mr. Trump was too late responding to the outbreak, according to a Pew Research Center survey this past week. More ominous for the president are some private Republican surveys that show him losing ground in key states like Michigan, where one recent poll has him losing by double digits, according to a Republican strategist who has seen it. So as Mr. Biden unites the Democratic Party, Mr. Trump’s poll numbers are flagging and G.O.P. senators up for re-election find themselves significantly outraised by their Democratic rivals. That has led to a growing urgency in Republican ranks that the president should shelve his hopes for a lucrative rapprochement with China. “At this moment in time a trade deal is not the right topic of discussion,” said Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, who said the pandemic had highlighted the country’s reliance on China in the same painful fashion that the oil crisis of the 1970s revealed how it was at the mercy of the Middle East. “This has exposed our dependency on China for P.P.E. and for critical drugs.” Mr. Hawley, a first-term Missouri senator has also denounced China, calling for a United States-led international commission to determine the origin of the virus and demanding that American victims be allowed to sue the Chinese government.“This is the 9/11 of this generation,” said Mr. Hawley, adding that he hopes Mr. Trump “keeps the pressure high.” He said Republicans should make the issue central this fall and demonstrate “how are we going to come out of this stronger by actually standing up to the Chinese.” Few Republicans have been more outspoken than Mr. Cotton, an Arkansan who was warning about the virus at the start of the year when few lawmakers were paying attention, and has been urging Senate candidates to make China a centerpiece of their campaigns.  “China unleashed this pandemic on the world and they should pay the price,” Mr. Cotton said. “Congress and the president should work together to hold China accountable.” Fortified by private polling his campaign conducted last year for his own re-election showing bipartisan disdain for China, Mr. Cotton’s top aides approached aides to Mr. Trump’s campaign last month and told them they planned to air an ad in Ohio, a few days before its scheduled primary, attacking Mr. Biden over China. But, according to Republicans familiar with the conversation, Mr. Trump’s campaign expressed little interest in coordinating with them. Now, though, Mr. Trump’s campaign is effectively repurposing Mr. Cotton’s ad and lashing Mr. Biden in a commercial targeting the former vice president and his son. The super PAC supporting Mr. Trump, America First, is airing ads on the same theme in swing states, showing video of Mr. Biden in 2011 saying that “a rising China is a positive development.”And the president’s eldest son, Donald Jr., posted the spot on Twitter and sought to stamp a new nickname on the former vice president: “BeijingBiden.” Brian O. Walsh, the president of America First Action, said the strategy builds on years of voter concerns about China. “The China piece of this was part of the overall thinking far before coronavirus, because we knew its potency and its relevance,” Mr. Walsh said. “This just made it more potent and more relevant.” In response to G.O.P. attacks, an outside Democratic group, American Bridge, on Friday unveiled a $15 million ad campaign hammering Mr. Trump for sending medical supplies to China and for initially praising the Chinese response to the virus. Mr. Cramer, of North Dakota, said Democrats were courting political risk if they were seen as defending China. But he conceded that Mr. Trump’s “rhetoric about Xi gets confusing.” “I’d have a hard time being that nice to a communist leader,” Mr. Cramer said, “but the president knows he’s got to appeal to an audience of one there.”Alexander Burns and Katie Glueck contributed reporting."
‘All of It Is Happening All at Once’: When Congress Works From Home,"WASHINGTON — One day this month, housebound and tired of the endless conference calls that have defined his existence during the coronavirus crisis, Representative Jesús G. Garcia put on a bright-red hooded sweatshirt and jeans, grabbed a shovel and hoe and headed for the little yard adjoining his home in southwest Chicago. “I said, ‘Come on, shoot me,’” said Mr. Garcia, a freshman Democrat who goes by the nickname Chuy, describing how he told his wife to take video of the scene. “She said, ‘You’re crazy.’ I said, ‘Just film.’” The result was “Gardening With Chuy,” a one-minute and 57-second Facebook and Instagram video set to music. Part pep talk, part public service announcement, it featured Mr. Garcia offering planting tips and life advice on how to “be creative around our homes” and keep “a good attitude about beating back the coronavirus.” With the Capitol shuttered until at least early May and the House now considering instituting remote voting to facilitate a more prolonged absence from Washington, members of Congress are sequestered at home like the rest of America, forced to reimagine how to do their jobs virtually. It is a singular challenge for lawmakers, whose tasks typically revolve around human contact with a rotating cast of constituents, staff, lobbyists and fellow lawmakers. They have come up with creative (some more than others) solutions. Here’s a look at how Congress is working from home:Now Recording: Representative Mike Gallagher All it took for Representative Mike Gallagher to turn the unfinished basement of his Green Bay, Wis., home into what he call his “command center” was a webcam, backlighting and a basic microphone, borrowed from his wife, the actress Anne Horak Gallagher. Some mismatched bookshelves and a well-placed Packers jersey livened up the shot. A podcast was born.The name of the show, “NEW Look,” is a reference to Dwight D. Eisenhower’s national security policy and to northeast Wisconsin. But Mr. Gallagher, 36, said the point was to try to bring his constituents high-quality information about the virus, and how to cope with it, at a time when misinformation has been circulating rampantly. “I don’t know, it’s just another way to provide what I think is useful and solid information to the people I represent, while nerding out on obscure Eisenhower stuff no one else cares about,” said Mr. Gallagher, a second-term Republican and former Marine who wrote a Ph.D. dissertation on the 34th president. One recent episode featured a conversation on Stoic philosophy during a pandemic. In others, Mr. Gallagher has interviewed health or biology experts. Just offscreen is a makeshift gym he assembled when he stopped going to his local CrossFit studio — an attempt to try to stay clearheaded as he works from home. Download numbers have been modest. But Mr. Gallagher insists that the thick of a crisis is no time to worry about burnishing a following. “That has kind of all gone by the wayside,” he said.The Senator Above the Garage: Senator Angus King Given social distancing requirements to slow the spread of the virus, it is no longer possible for lawmakers to hold their customary town-hall-style meetings. Some have turned to teleconferences, drawing thousands of constituents. Senator Angus King, independent of Maine, has found — somewhat accidentally — that the great outdoors will do, too. Who needs a town hall when you have a wide-open field?“It is a little bit awkward to be six feet or eight feet or 10 feet apart, but you can still communicate,” Mr. King, 76, said of his open-air encounters with business leaders, a former state attorney general and other residents of his hometown, Brunswick, as he traverses its open spaces. Upon returning from Washington last month, Mr. King took up residence in the Brunswick Inn out of an abundance of caution, and later moved to an empty apartment above his garage before moving back into his house. Mr. King and his wife, Mary Herman, regularly take socially distant walks to stretch their legs, and he says the interruptions have been welcome. Mr. King, a former governor, said the outbreak had stirred memories of a crippling ice storm in Maine in 1998 that knocked out power for at least half of the state’s residents amid deadly cold. In that case, neighbors and families had to take care of one another. “The government has an important role to play in supporting the economy, finding a vaccine, supporting the supply chain for personal protective gear,” Mr. King said. “But ultimately, it is up to us as individuals to limit the spread of this disease.” Home School and Social Work: Representative Jahana Hayes Before she ran for Congress, Representative Jahana Hayes, Democrat of Connecticut, was named the 2016 National Teacher of the Year. Now, Ms. Hayes, a freshman congresswoman, is dusting off her teaching skills with her own son, while working marathon days. Her office, technically on the fourth floor of the Longworth House Office Building in Washington, can be found these days on a cluttered folding table in the living room of her Wolcott, Conn., home. Her son, Myles, 11, is occupying her regular desk. Ms. Hayes, 47, works at a crowded spare table she hauled in from the shed. Forget privacy.“All of it is happening all at once,” she said. “There are days when I have had eight hours straight of conference calls, and then I spend three hours before going to bed catching up on emails, letters or proposed legislation that my staff has sent during the day.” When one call ends, Ms. Hayes will often snap a photograph of her notes and text it to staff members for follow-up before she starts her next. Aside from drive-in church services, Ms. Hayes’s world — which used to include weekly trips to the nation’s capital — has now narrowed considerably, to her home and yard. Exercise comes in bursts of square laps around her deck and occasional virtual yoga classes, led by a constituent. When she has the time, she imagines how all these new ways of connecting remotely will change the institution in which she serves. Much of the time, her day resembles social work. Every couple of days, Ms. Hayes and her aides each pick five people, organizations or businesses to personally call and check in on, in addition to fielding the incoming calls flooding her office lines for help applying for unemployment benefits or small-business loans. In one case, a nursing home just needed to find toilet paper. Ms. Hayes went and bought it herself. “You can hear the desperation in their voices,” she said, “because oftentimes, they don’t know who else to call.” The Not-Very-Secret Diary of Representative Debbie Dingell. Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, has never been one to keep her feelings inside. But the coronavirus pandemic has her sharing her innermost thoughts (and body-temperature readings) in public, in an intimate diary posted on her Facebook page. “Day 31,” she wrote Wednesday morning, offering a recap of Tuesday. “Temperature 97.5. Sleep very elusive tonight and don’t even know why. I think the pacing in this house, living on the phone, never stop moving even when on the phone, gray temples and the worse looking nails you have ever seen may be getting to me.” Mrs. Dingell, 66, has lived alone since her husband, the former congressman John D. Dingell, died last year, and her entries make clear how much she misses other people — “mornings with the boys at Starbucks”; “union halls where the guys and gals are real”; “my veterans and their stories.” The information she shares runs the gamut, be it an Easter missive from her mother or a report on her efforts to help auto plant workers and hospitals and nurses who lack the proper protective equipment. On a recent day, she included questions submitted during her virtual town-hall-style meeting with Toyota employees, including: “Can we get FDA approval for Ford’s N-95 Masks. Someone has respirators….do we have someone that would pay for them.” She has turned her kitchen into an office, she said in an interview, noting that the room has big windows and she likes to see people walking past outside. She works with three telephones — a hard line and two cellphones — two iPads that belonged to her husband, and two of her own. On Wednesday, she said, she learned how to do two Zoom conference calls at once. “I never stop talking,” she said.‘I Want to Do What I’ve Done for 40 Years’: Senator Charles GrassleyHoled up on his farm in New Hartford, Iowa, Senator Charles E. Grassley, 86, does not see much upside to Zoom. He has tried FaceTime for some family check-ins, but not for official business. No, for the longest-serving Senate Republican, the phone does quite nicely. “I am trying to keep in touch with everything I would normally do through long distance,” he said the other day. He ticked through a dozen or so recent calls: to local TV and radio stations, with Iowa cattlemen and the state’s pork producers. Mr. Grassley, accustomed to predawn runs in Washington, has started jogging in the afternoon sun. Last weekend, when the family farm would normally have been overrun by four generations of Grassleys, he and his wife quietly prayed at home alone and logged onto FaceTime to share the Easter holiday. Other traditions cannot be digitized. Every year since at least 1981, Mr. Grassley has made a point of convening a town meeting in every one of Iowa’s 99 counties to face voters who set the agenda of each session. This year, he was only able to complete about a dozen before the virus froze his state in place. “I sometimes do telephone town halls, but I have never had them take the place of a county meeting, because I want to do what I have done for 40 years,” he said. “I want to be physically in every county.”"
Vote for Biden? Sanders Supporters Say It’s ‘Up in the Air’,"Mary Shippee voted for Senator Bernie Sanders in Wisconsin’s Democratic primary this month, well after it was clear he had no chance to become the party’s presidential nominee. Now that Mr. Sanders has dropped out and endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Shippee is torn over whether to once again cast a vote for a moderate Democrat in November, after grudgingly supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016 and President Barack Obama in 2012. “What it feels like is the Democratic Party relies on guilting progressives into voting for them, and they don’t want to have any meaningful changes,” said Ms. Shippee, 31, a nursing student in Milwaukee. “For the third election in a row, to have a candidate you’re not excited about makes me a little more interested in voting third party.” Despite Mr. Sanders’s call to unite behind Mr. Biden to defeat President Trump — whom the Vermont senator described as “the most dangerous president” of modern times — and despite Mr. Obama’s assurance that the party had moved left since he left office, the youthful and impassioned army of Sanders supporters is far from ready to embrace a nominee so unlike the one they pinned their dreams on. In interviews with two dozen Sanders primary voters across the country this week, there was a nearly universal lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Some called him a less formidable candidate than Hillary Clinton was in 2016. Many were skeptical of his ability to beat Mr. Trump. Others were quick to critique Mr. Biden’s sometimes incoherent speech. Taken together, the voters’ doubts raised questions about how many would show up for Mr. Biden in November, including their likelihood to volunteer and organize for him, an important measure of enthusiasm. In a poll last month, four out of five Sanders supporters said they would vote for Mr. Biden, with 15 percent saying they would cross over to Mr. Trump, about the same share that did so in 2016. Te’wuan Thorne, 24, said it was “up in the air” whether he would vote. A Sanders supporter who recently moved to New York City from Pennsylvania, where he is registered to vote, he said, “If I happen to be at my polling place, I would vote for Biden, but I’m not very enthusiastic about him whatsoever.” Some Sanders primary voters said they would back a third-party candidate, a few said they would vote for Mr. Trump, and some were wavering about voting at all. Daniel Ray, 27, of Lancaster, Penn., planned to write in Tulsi Gabbard, the congresswoman from Hawaii who ended her long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination last month. In Facebook groups for Sanders supporters and on Twitter, cynicism persisted about the olive branches on policy that Mr. Biden has offered to progressives and, at the extreme, some accused Mr. Sanders of selling out his leftist movement. It is clear, if it wasn’t already, that the Sanders base is far different from the supporters of moderate candidates in the primaries, who moved on quickly from their first choices to coalesce around Mr. Biden early last month. For Mr. Sanders, bringing his people on board will not be easy, even though he endorsed Mr. Biden with seeming affection and months earlier than he did Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Nathaniel Kesselring of Tucson voted for Mr. Sanders in the Arizona primary but said he would not vote for Mr. Biden because progressives should not compromise on issues like “Medicare for all” and free public college tuition. “If we don’t declare as a movement that this isn’t good enough,” Mr. Kesselring said, referring to Mr. Biden’s moderate policies, “then the Democratic Party has every right to ignore us. I hate the idea of Donald Trump being president for another term, but if that’s what we need to do to make these people take us seriously, that’s what needs to be done.” “I hate it,” repeated Mr. Kesselring, 45, the vice president of a buyer’s club for diabetes products. “I hate it. But I’m not moving.” Certainly, as polling shows, the majority of Sanders voters plan to support Mr. Biden. Most of those interviewed who intend to do so called it a hold-your-nose election. “I will vote for him; Biden is better than Trump, sure,” said Stephen Phillips, 33, who lives in Lakeland, Fla., and has been furloughed from his job in talent recruitment because of the coronavirus outbreak. But he cringed watching Mr. Sanders’s live-streamed endorsement of Mr. Biden on Monday, when the senator spoke extemporaneously while the former vice president seemed to be reading off cue cards. “This guy is going to be running against Donald Trump, who off the cuff can destroy anybody with words.” Maria Aviles-Hernandez, 24, a Spanish teacher near Rocky Mount, N.C., didn’t vote in 2016 but plans to support Mr. Biden, although Mr. Sanders was her first choice. “I will vote this year, I will make sure of that,” she said. “I didn’t expect Trump to win the first time. The world just surprised me. I don’t want that to happen again.” A challenge for Mr. Biden in the fall is that even if he has the grudging support of Sanders voters, many may not go out of their way to vote, either by applying for absentee ballots or by traveling home if they are students. “For a college student, the barriers to get to the voting place are very real,” said Victoria Waring, 21, whose family home is in central Pennsylvania but who attends college in Philadelphia, studying film and animation. “A lot of my friends are disillusioned with the Democratic Party, they feel there’s nothing they can do to be represented, that the establishment will pick whoever they want and it doesn’t matter what we say.” In 2016, before she was old enough to vote, Ms. Waring organized for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. Ms. Waring said she would not volunteer this year for the Biden campaign. “How could I in good faith tell someone to vote for someone who I don’t agree with on any issue?” she asked. “I can’t. No. Absolutely not.” One survey after the 2016 election indicated that 12 percent of Mr. Sanders’s primary voters ended up voting for Mr. Trump in the general election. Another 8 percent of Sanders supporters voted for a third-party candidate, and 3 percent did not vote. The numbers were in line with past elections when a losing candidate’s primary voters did not support the nominee. But because the 2016 race was so close, with Mr. Trump winning by less than one percentage point in three crucial Rust Belt states, the Sanders drop-off voters helped tilt the election away from Mrs. Clinton. Some Sanders supporters, to be sure, will be voting for Mr. Biden without hesitation. Nathalia Calderon, 34, of Milford, Mich, said that before the state’s primary on March 10, which was a kind of last stand for Mr. Sanders, she had planned to vote for the Vermont senator. But she changed her mind before the election and voted for Mr. Biden instead.  “I believed in all the things Bernie wanted to do, but then I was doing a little more research and realized what he wanted to do wasn’t realistic,’’ she said. “When someone promises you the moon, most likely it isn’t going to happen.” She voted for Mr. Biden in the primary and looks forward to doing so again in November. But many younger voters, who overwhelmingly backed Mr. Sanders in this year’s primary race, said Mr. Biden seemed like just another politician with wishy-washy positions on climate change and health care. What they craved, they said, was the type of fundamental change that Mr. Sanders has espoused for decades. “Joe Biden, he seems fake to me,” said Jacob Davids, 21, a college student in Milwaukee. “I don’t know his policies, and if you haven’t put enough effort into P.R. and media to make viewers like me know where you stand, I’m not going to vote for you.” Kevin Ridler, 55, voted for Mr. Sanders in this year’s Democratic primary and cast a ballot for Mr. Trump in the 2016 general election. Mr. Ridler lives in rural western Iowa and is the president of a railway maintenance workers’ local in the Midwest. He said he had believed Mr. Trump’s promises that he would be a friend of American workers. Immediately after the election, Mr. Ridler said, his union’s railroad employer refused to renegotiate a contract, citing a “new political climate,” and workers were forced to take a pay cut. Mr. Ridler now calls his vote for Mr. Trump “a mistake” that he will not repeat.He supported Mr. Sanders in Iowa’s caucuses. But he has a powerful dislike of Mr. Biden, whom he called dishonest, throwing in a few epithets. “I think he’s got dementia,” he said. “Honestly, I hate to not vote at all,” he said, speaking from a railway bridge under construction outside Jefferson City, Mo. “I know that’s not the right thing to do, but that’s kind of what’s going to happen here.” Robert Grullon, 29, a carpenter at a door factory near Melbourne, Fla., liked Mr. Sanders’s promises to raise the minimum wage and provide health care for all. “We love Bernie,” he said. “Bernie’s our guy.” He complained that Hispanic voters and black voters — he is third-generation Dominican-American — tend to support Democrats but don’t get much back. “When are they going to have something for blacks and Hispanics, just for us?” he said. Mr. Biden struck him as just another politician in a blue suit. “To tell you the truth, Trump might get my vote,” he said. “Donald Trump is a person who’s always been known in our community — I like hip-hop — we idolized him because he was a billionaire, he has been in rap videos, he has friends who are African-American.” In eastern Iowa on Tuesday, Kelly Manning had just finished her route as a letter carrier for the Postal Service, which has lost millions in revenue during the pandemic even as Mr. Trump tries to block relief funding for the agency. Ms. Manning, 55, caucused for Mr. Sanders in Burlington, on the Mississippi River. She heard Mr. Biden speak when he came through Iowa, though she said he had made her nearly doze off. “I’ll hold my nose and vote for Biden,” she said.Her 31-year-old son, Mason Blow, is another matter. A staunch Sanders supporter, he voted for a third-party candidate in 2016. Ms. Manning said she and her sister were “working on him” to vote for Mr. Biden, to prevent a second Trump term. “He said he won’t vote for Biden, he’s going to write in Bernie this time,” Ms. Manning said. “The younger people, they’re not used to having their dream crushed as we are.”"
Gretchen Whitmer Isn’t Backing Down,"She is a first-term governor and rising star in the Democratic Party, a frequent critic of the Trump administration for its handling of the coronavirus health crisis and a prominent foil of the president’s in the heated debate over when to reopen the nation for business. Now the governor, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, has also become a prime target in the growing partisan storm over stay-at-home orders during the outbreak, which was highlighted on Wednesday by a raucous protest at the state capital, followed by Mr. Trump’s call on Friday to his followers to “Liberate Michigan.’’ The debate over how soon to loosen restrictions on businesses and workers has moved from the hands of health experts to become an increasingly political fight over costs to the economy, which Mr. Trump sees as crucial to his re-election. Ms. Whitmer, a potential vice-presidential pick, has stirred Republican fears that her growing popularity will help Democrats carry the battleground state of Michigan in November, whether or not she is on the ticket. “I think it’s impossible to look at this and not feel there’s a lot of partisanship going on as it relates to Governor Whitmer,’’ said Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat and Michigan’s senior senator. The traffic-snarling protest on Wednesday that drew a few thousand people to Lansing, Mich., including many flying Tea Party flags and Trump 2020 flags, was nominally called to oppose Ms. Whitmer’s latest stay-at-home order, one of the strictest in the nation. But the gathering, like similar ones held in the electoral battleground states of Ohio, Minnesota and North Carolina, was also the clearest sign yet of a simmering ideological movement on the right resisting government mandates over the virus. “It felt a lot more like a political rally than a statement about the stay-home order,’’ Ms. Whitmer said in an interview the next day. Mr. Trump has been insulting and condescending toward Ms. Whitmer, calling her “Half Whitmer” and “the woman in Michigan.” Asked on Thursday at the White House if the protesters in Michigan should listen to their governor, Mr. Trump replied: “I think they listen to me. They seem to be protesters that like me and respect this opinion.” On Friday, he kept up the pressure, tweeting “Liberate Michigan’’ along with similar tweets for Virginia and Minnesota, which also have Democratic governors. His tweets came moments after a Fox News broadcast of protesters in state capitals violating social-distancing rules. But unlike those two other Democratic governors, Ms. Whitmer is a Republican target because, among other reasons, she is in widely seen as in contention to be Joseph R. Biden’s running mate this fall. In the interview, Ms. Whitmer said she has spoken recently with Mr. Biden about managing the pandemic. “He’s called to check in a few times just to see what’s going on in Michigan, to ask thoughtful questions about what we need, but you know, we haven’t had that conversation,’’ she said, referring to Mr. Biden’s hunt for a vice-presidential candidate. Asked if she thought she was prepared to be vice president, Ms. Whitmer, a former Democratic leader of the State Senate, who was known for her careful political timing under Republican majorities, deflected. “Honestly every ounce of energy I have is being put into protecting people and saving lives in Michigan,’’ she said. “I’m not thinking about politics. I’m not. I don’t have energy for any of that right now.’’ The protests at state capitals in recent days had the feel of early Tea Party rallies in 2009, with far-right conservatives taking a lead role and more cautious elected Republicans keeping their distance. While polling shows that overwhelming majorities of voters are chiefly concerned about the public health threat, it also indicates that the most conservative Americans are more likely to be irked by the idea that their local economy might stay closed for a long time. In a survey released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, very conservative Americans were twice as likely as others to worry that businesses would reopen too slowly. Yet very conservative voters were also unlikely to be too concerned about the virus’s economic impact. A Fox News poll out last week found that the most conservative voters tended to express less worry than others that the shutdown could send the economy into recession. These ideas may seem hard to square, but the rhetoric of protest organizers and hard-line media personalities provides at least a partial explanation: very conservative voters are more likely to allude to a sense of outrage over having their public conduct restricted, rather than caution about the economic implications of the shutdown. John Anzalone, Ms. Whitmer’s pollster and a Michigan native, said the protests were not “reflective of real people” in a state where most are more worried that they or a family member will get sick than the they are about the economic impact of stay-at-home orders. But Mr. Anzalone said the right would only grow louder the longer the restrictions are in place. “She is reflective of the pressure other governors are going to get,” he said. In Michigan, the state with the third-highest number of deaths from Covid-19, Ms. Whitmer imposed some of the country’s most severe restrictions on April 9, including a ban on travel to vacation homes and the sale in large stores of paint, garden supplies and furniture. Her order was mocked on social media with posts of seed aisles cordoned off, criticisms that morphed into misinformation that was amplified by national Republican figures, including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.  Republican lawmakers in Michigan, who had backed an earlier, less restrictive executive order, blasted the governor. They moved to strip Ms. Whitmer’s power to declare a state of emergency under a 1945 law. “Here’s my message today: OUR Governor IS DESTROYING OUR HEALTH BY KILLING OUR LIVELIHOODS!” the State Senate majority leader, Mike Shirkey, tweeted this month. On Monday, the governor accused the DeVos family, a wealthy and powerful force in Michigan Republican politics, of a role in the protest at the Capitol. Without naming Betsy DeVos, President Trump’s education secretary, Ms. Whitmer said it was “really inappropriate for a sitting member of the United States president’s cabinet to be waging political attacks on any governor, but obviously me here at home.” One of the named hosts of the protest was the Michigan Freedom Fund, a conservative group with ties to the DeVos family. Its executive director, Tony Daunt, said the group’s only role was to promote the event on Facebook, at a cost of $250 to be listed as a co-host. Mr. Daunt said Ms. Whitmer’s initial, less restrictive stay-at-home orders in March had bipartisan support, but she lost credibility with her tighter restrictions, which he called “dismissive” of people’s concerns about lost livelihoods. Her frequent appearances on national TV, including the “Daily Show” with Trevor Noah and the Rachel Maddow show on MSNBC on Thursday, also set off conservatives. Mr. Daunt accused Ms. Whitmer of putting more “focus on the Biden veepstakes, as opposed to handling the crisis here in our own backyard.” The governor called the charge “baloney,’’ defending her television appearances as chances to educate viewers about the virus, which attract offers of help for Michigan. “You know what, it would be wrong not to do everything I could on both those fronts,’’ she said. But even some Democrats in the state have raised an eyebrow at her ubiquity on national television. Few other states outside the northeast have been as hard hit by the virus as Michigan, which recorded 2,226 deaths as of Friday, and where the intersection of race, presidential politics and Ms. Whitmer’s vice-presidential prospects have turned the perennial battleground into a political tinderbox. With the outbreak concentrated in heavily black and Democratic Detroit, the virus was already threatening to exacerbate the widening political divide between rural and urban Michigan. For decades, Democrats enjoyed strength with working-class whites in rural Michigan. But as in much of the country, those voters have drifted to the G.O.P. over the last decade. Now, even when Democrats win statewide, as they did when Ms. Whitmer succeeded a Republican in 2018, they do so by piling up large margins in metropolitan areas and losing many of the less-populated counties where they once were strong. And the images of nearly all-white protesters demanding the governor relax restrictions while hoisting Trump signs and Confederate battle flags, as the virus disproportionately impacts Michigan’s black residents, will only further cleave the state. Less noticed is another flash point. A number of white Michiganders — many of them affluent but some firmly in the middle-class — have summer homes “up north,” as the sprawling upper tier of the state’s lower peninsula is called. Ms. Whitmer’s order that people not travel between their residences — meant to protect rural towns and rural hospitals from being overwhelmed with the virus — has particularly inflamed those state residents eager to get to their cottages. Of course, for the heavily black work force in and around Detroit that can’t retreat to a vacation home, such an inconvenience is trifling by comparison. Many of these workers plays critical roles running the region’s vitally needed grocery stores, pharmacies and busses. “Black people’s lives haven’t changed in many ways because everyday was always a grind to survive,” said Adam Hollier, a state senator from Detroit, adding that “grocery store clerk, home health care, bus drivers, sanitation, custodial staff — the people who are often deemed most replaceable are the ones we actually can’t live without.”Susan Beachy contributed research."
U.S. Military Cutting Medevac Flights for Troops in West Africa,"WASHINGTON — The United States military is sharply reducing its emergency casualty evacuation services in West Africa, raising concerns that American troops on missions there could be left vulnerable if they run into trouble at a time when violence is surging in that corner of the continent. The action by the Pentagon’s Africa Command comes shortly after U.S. military advisers accompanied forces in Niger last month on a major counterterrorism operation near Diffa, a small town on the border with Nigeria that has been a hot spot for attacks by the militant group Boko Haram. It was the first time American forces in Niger had joined a combat mission alongside their local counterparts since 2017, when U.S. commanders imposed strict guidelines on ground forces. Those new restrictions were imposed after an ambush in October that year near the border with Mali that left four American soldiers dead. At issue now is the military’s decision to cancel a $23 million annual contract with Erickson, an aviation services company that flies logistics and casualty evacuation flights for Army Green Berets who have been training and advising Nigerien troops for two years in Arlit, a remote city in northern Niger. The Nigerien troops have been conducting operations to intercept terrorists as they flow in and out of Libya. But that mission has faded. The Green Berets, members of the 20th Special Forces Group from Alabama, are moving some 500 miles southwest of Arlit to carry out a higher-priority mission to help confront a toxic mix of Islamic State and Al Qaeda fighters in the tri-border region of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. The Africa Command says it already has enough medevac support for that area and no longer needs Erickson’s two Bell 214ST helicopters. But some lawmakers and military officials voice concern that the responsibility for handling any casualty evacuation flights will now fall on a single H225 Super Puma helicopter operated from Niamey, Niger’s capital, by another contractor, Berry Aviation. Erickson and Berry currently back up each either if their aircraft cannot fly for mechanical or other reasons. “A lack of support can have serious results when troops are faced with a hostile and determined foe,” Representative Michael Waltz, Republican of Florida and former Army Green Beret who served in West Africa, said in a letter on March 12 to Pentagon officials, raising questions about the Africa Command’s decision. Battlefield commanders have described medical aid to troops on the ground as an ethical obligation. The Defense Department in war zones like Afghanistan and Iraq have followed a “golden-hour standard,” in which the military seeks to whisk wounded American troops from the battlefield within an hour of being wounded to give them access to advanced care and the best chance to save their lives. But in Africa, the time frame for evacuating injured American troops is much longer, particularly in the expanse of West Africa’s Sahel region, a vast sub-Saharan scrubland that stretches from Senegal to Sudan. Niger alone is nearly twice the size of Texas. In the case of the deadly ambush in October 2017 on the Niger-Mali border, it took more than four hours to evacuate the dead and wounded. The lack of timely help called into question whether the American military is providing enough resources for troops undertaking dangerous missions in Africa. The large, remote stretches in which American Special Forces operate are inherently dangerous because of their inaccessibility and are conducive to ambushes. Col. Christopher P. Karns, the chief spokesman for the Africa Command, which is based in Stuttgart, Germany, said that the Erickson contract was not being renewed because the troops Erickson supported were being repositioned. “Medical evacuation capacity exists where they are moving, so we assess no increased risk to our forces,” Colonel Karns said in response to questions from The New York Times. “Existing resources can meet the needs of repositioned forces.” The United States has about 1,200 troops in West Africa, with about 800 of them in Niger.Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper is weighing deep cuts to American troop on the continent, closing a new $110 million drone base in Niger and ending aid to French forces battling militants who are surging in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. Mr. Esper had been expected to make a final decision last month, as part of a global reshuffling of American forces to address new threats from China and Russia. But the coronavirus pandemic and its projected effect on the continent have delayed the process, Pentagon officials said. Colonel Karns said the decision to end Erickson’s contract in mid-June was made before Mr. Esper’s review got underway, and is not related to the secretary’s assessment. Kevin S. Cochie, a vice president for Erickson, which is based in Portland, Ore., declined to comment on details of the contract. “Whether it’s U.S. personnel in need or our partner forces, we have launched and responded in the aftermath of unforeseen situations and contributed to saving life and limb,” said Mr. Cochie, a retired Army Special Operations helicopter pilot. “From a business perspective, it’s unfortunate that we are winding down a contract in Africa.” Erickson’s medevac helicopters were on standby for the American military advisers and the Nigerien forces during the operation in Diffa on March 9-10, but there were no casualties, military officials said. While Erickson has not been summoned to evacuate wounded American personnel in Niger since late 2017, the company’s helicopters have evacuated Nigerien troops who were wounded in counterterrorism missions, including major operations in December 2019 and January 2020, according to people familiar with the missions. About 90 percent of Erickson’s missions in the past two years have involved ferrying cargo or troops; 10 percent involved evacuating injured Nigerien military personnel, Mr. Cochie said. Erickson supports American troops in other hot spots around the world, including Marine Special Operations forces in the southern Philippines. Stanley Finch, the president of Berry Aviation, referred all questions to the Africa Command.Some military officials say the risk of casualties to American service members in West Africa has decreased following the restrictions imposed after the October 2017 ambush. Moreover, U.S. force levels in the region are likely to be cut as a result of Mr. Esper’s review. But the operation in Diffa last month, in which a dozen or so American advisers helped a much larger force of Nigerian and Nigerien troops target a senior Boko Haram leader, underscores that the risk to American troops still remains. The Americans set up “a good ways” away from the targeted area, Colonel Karns said. And the mission ultimately failed to capture or kill the militant leader, military officials said. But if one thing has been made clear for American forces operating in places such as Niger and Somalia, it is that proximity to partner forces and mission objectives has meant little when it comes to deadly attacks. Even so, the episode suggests the restrictions on American troops accompanying Nigerien forces on high-level missions may be loosening. “We will continue to support our partners’ initiatives to disrupt violent extremists while managing the risk to our forces,” Brig. Gen. Dagvin R.M. Anderson, who commands U.S. Special Operations forces in Africa, said in a statement. “These mutually beneficial partnerships ultimately help defend U.S. interests and our homeland.” Some aviation specialists say Erickson’s Bell helicopters are better suited for the Sahel’s extreme heat and dusty conditions than Berry’s Super Puma, an advanced aircraft often used to ferry passengers and supplies to offshore oil platforms. A former commander of American Special Operations forces in Africa, Maj. Gen. J. Marcus Hicks, said that one broader solution would be to restructure the remaining contract to increase the number of helicopters available for logistics or casualty evacuation duties. “I would recommend taking a holistic view of adjusting capabilities rather than simply reducing resources,” General Hicks said in a telephone interview.Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting."
