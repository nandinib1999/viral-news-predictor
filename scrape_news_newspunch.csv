US Doctors Are Pumping Men  Full of FEMALE SEX HORMONES To ‘Fight Coronavirus’,"Two hospitals in the US are now experimenting on men with coronavirus by pumping them full of estrogen and progesterone to see if the female sex hormones boost their immune systems and reduce the severity of the illness. Stony Brook University in New York and Cedars-Sinai in California are giving male coronavirus patients estrogen and progesterone because doctors are wondering if the female sex hormones could make men more likely to survive the novel coronavirus. Across the world, women from most countries have been less likely to become ill with the virus, and less likely to die from it. This has led many researchers to wonder if the hormones mainly produced in women could be protective, reported The New York Times. DailyMail report: Last month, Italy’s public health research agency said that more than 70 percent of the country’s deaths have been in men. And, in February, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said the fatality rate among men with coronavirus was 65 percent higher than among women.  Scientists say they don’t know why women seem less likely to die, but have suggested that women naturally tend to have stronger immune systems and are less likely to have long-term health conditions which make patients more vulnerable.  In China, researchers pointed the finger at men being more likely to smoke and drink, but this was a cultural factor which may be different in other countries.     This soon became apparent in the US. In New York, more than 60 percent of the state’s deaths have been among men. Early research has suggested the hormones may reduce the number of ACE2 receptors on the surfaces of cells that the virus uses to enter the body. The Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University in Long Island, New York will be investigating estrogen, the primary female sex hormone.  Estrogen helps develop and regulate the female reproductive system and plays a role in secondary sex characteristics. Dr Sharon Nachman, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases, told The Times that the trial enrolled its first participant last week. She hopes to have preliminary results in the next couple of months.   ‘It’s totally out of the box, which is how good ideas often start,’ Dr Nachman, associate dean for research at the Renaissance School, which is part of the State University of New York.  The Stony Brook University estrogen trial hopes to recruit 110 patients who visit the emergency room and have symptoms such as coughing, fever or shortness of breath. They either have to test positive for COVID-19 – the disease caused by the virus – or are presumed to have it, just as long  as they don’t need to be intubated. Half will be given an estradiol patch for one week and the other half will be a control group. Researchers will see if the hormone helps reduce the disease’s severity. The hypothesis is that the hormone could help clear the infection and prevent cytokine storms, which is when the body doesn’t just fight off the virus but also attacks its own cells and tissues, from occurring.   ‘We may not understand exactly how estrogen works, but maybe we can see how the patient does,’ Dr Nachman told The Times. ‘While we see women do get infected, their responses are different. We see fewer of them having the second, disregulated immune response.’         Next week, researchers in Los Angeles will begin testing another sex hormone found mainly in women, progesterone. It has been shown to reduce inflammation and prevent the immune system from overreacting to outside pathogens. ‘There’s a striking difference between the number of men and women in the intensive care unit, and men are clearly doing worse,’ Dr Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care physician at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, told The Times. She told the newspaper that 75 percent of her hospital’s intensive care patients and patients on ventilators are men.  Around 40 male patients will be enrolled in the Cedars-Sinai study, all of whom have tested positive for the virus and have mild to moderate cases. Half of the participants will be given two shots of progesterone per day for five days and the other half will be a control group.  Researchers will see if this help control their oxygen levels and prevent the need to go the ICU or be intubated.   Similarly to the estrogen study, the theory is that progesterone will also prevent cytokine storms. Dr Ghandedari said she has also seen that the majority of ill pregnant women, who typically high levels of both hormones, have midl case of the virus. ‘So something about being a woman is protective, and something about pregnancy is protective, and that makes us think about hormones,’ she said.  Both hospitals told The Times that all male participants will be warned of possible side effects such as hot flashes and breast tenderness.  #BidenIsOverParty: Tara Reade’s Neighbor Corroborates Sex Assault Allegation Against Joe Biden

#BidenIsOverParty: Tara Reade’s Neighbor Corroborates Sex Assault Allegation Against Joe Biden,"A woman has come forward and corroborated claims that Joe Biden violently sexually assaulted former staffer Tara Reade in 1993.   Lynda LaCasse, a former neighbor to Reade, says she and Reade discussed the horrific sexual assault two years after it allegedly occurred, declaring: “This happened, and I know it did because I remember talking about it.” In an interview with the AP, Reade detailed a 1993 encounter she says occurred when she was asked by a manager to bring Senator Biden his gym bag, as he was on his way down to the Senate gymnasium. Reade claims Biden shoved her up against a wall in the basement, groped her, and then forcefully penetrated her with his fingers.   “He was whispering to me and trying to kiss me at the same time, and he was saying, ‘Do you want to go somewhere else?’” she said. “I remember wanting to say stop, but I don’t know if I said it out loud or if I just thought it. I was kind of frozen up.” Reade said that when she tried to pull away from Biden, he looked “shocked and surprised” and replied, “Come on, man, I heard you liked me.” In an interview with Business Insider, LaCasse said she distinctly remembers Reade being an emotional mess after the assault by Biden.  “I remember her saying, here was this person that she was working for and she idolized him,” LaCasse told the outlet. “And he kind of put her up against a wall. And he put his hand up her skirt and he put his fingers inside her. She felt like she was assaulted, and she really didn’t feel there was anything she could do.” “She was crying,” LaCasse added. “She was upset. And the more she talked about it, the more she started crying. I remember saying that she needed to file a police report.” “I don’t remember all the details,” she continued. “I remember the skirt. I remember the fingers. I remember she was devastated.” LaCasse, a Biden supporter, is the first person to corroborate Reade’s sexual assault allegation against Biden. “I personally am a Democrat, a very strong Democrat,” LaCasse confirmed. “And I’m for Biden, regardless. But still I have to come out and say this.” Related: Pelosi Endorses Biden Despite Credible Sex Assault Claims: ‘the Personification of Integrity’ Breitbart.com reports: In addition to LaCasse, Lorraine Sanchez, a former legislative staffer to California State Senator Jack O’Connell, told Business Insider that Reade lamented about being “sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in DC.” “What I do remember,” Sanchez explained “is reassuring her that nothing like that would ever happen to her here in our office, that she was in a safe place, free from any sexual harassment.” Sanchez recounts that Reade was talking about Biden. Sanchez lauded Reade’s resolve to speak out about her allegation, telling Business Insider: “It takes great courage and strength to come forward.” “It’s much easier to keep silent. However, I also understand the duty we have as women to share our story regardless of who the perpetrator may be,” she added. Sanchez reportedly worked with Reade between 1994 and 1996. The development comes after fresh evidence supporting Reade’s assault claim resurfaced Friday. A video segment, dug up by NewsBusters, appears to show Reade’s mother talking about her daughter’s “problems” with a “prominent senator” on CNN’s Larry King Live in 1993. #BREAKING: HERE is the video from August 11,1993's 'Larry King Live' described by @TheIntercept (and Tara Reade) as allegedly featuring her mother calling in and alluding to Reade's sexual assault claims against @JoeBiden (blog here by @ScottJW) https://t.co/fCgEqBnX7n pic.twitter.com/V5FGHskv56 “I’m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington? My daughter has just left there, after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him,” the caller who Reade identifies as her mother is heard saying. The call was first reported by The Intercept. Kate Bedingfield, Biden’s deputy campaign manager, issued a statement earlier this month denying the allegation. “Vice President Biden has dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women. He authored and fought for the passage and reauthorization of the landmark Violence Against Women Act. He firmly believes that women have a right to be heard — and heard respectfully. Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press. What is clear about this claim: it is untrue. This absolutely did not happen,” said Bedingfield. Biden has yet to personally respond to the allegation. USA Will NOT Participate in W.H.O. Vaccine Project US Doctors Are Pumping Men  Full of FEMALE SEX HORMONES To ‘Fight Coronavirus’ 
			 "
USA Will NOT Participate in W.H.O. Vaccine Project,"The USA will not participate in a World Health Organization effort to develop a vaccine to combat the Chinese coronavirus.  A spokesman for the US mission confirmed that “there will be no US official participation” in the programme. “We look forward to learning more about this initiative in support of international cooperation to develop a vaccine for Covid-19 as soon as possible,” the spokesman said. The withdrawal from the W.H.O. program follows President Trump’s announcement that the US government would halt funding to the corrupt organization for “covering up” the coronavirus outbreak from China.  The move to develop a worldwide vaccine was launched by globalists French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday. Macron, an outspoken critic of President Trump, said he hopes to “reconcile around this joint initiative both China and the US, because this is about saying the fight against Covid-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle.” The group has vowed to provide vaccine to countries across the planet and make ‘global’ decisions about how to best treat the coronavirus outbreak. Independent.co.uk reports: The US is suspending $400m in funds for WHO after the president claimed that the organisation took China’s claims about the virus “at face value” and now must be “held accountable”. WHO general-director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesys said last week that “now is the time for us to be united against a common struggle” in his rebuke of the president’s claims. He said: “When we’re divided, the virus exploits the cracks between us.” The director-general had previously criticised the president for politicising the virus, saying that “now is not the time for pointing fingers”.

Do the world a favor. You don’t want to be president. Go work at Mar-a-Lago. Have a nice rest of your life. This guy is out of his f-cking mind. I don’t know what Donald is doing. I mean, when he holds a press conference, it’s like you go oh f-ck.” “I don’t know what to say what’s going on with Donald. I mean, these statements are idiotic. Hey, I have this idea. Maybe since Clorox works on surfaces, couldn’t they just pour Clorox into your asshole,” he continued.  “I would love it if Donald would get on TV and take an injection of Clorox and let’s see if his theory works. Let him, volunteer. Or hold a big rally, say f-ck this coronavirus, with all of his followers, and let them hug each other and kiss each other and have a big, big rally.” Co-host Robin Quivers added, “A big cocktail of disinfectant.” “Yeah, and all take disinfectant and all drop dead,” Stern responded. “It’s an embarrassment. And then the bigger embarrassment is the insult to my intelligence were he goes ‘I was being sarcastic.’ There was no sarcasm. And if he was being sarcastic, that is even worse people are dying. This us no time for sarcasm.” Pelosi Endorses Biden Despite Credible Sex Assault Claims: ‘the Personification of Integrity’ USA Will NOT Participate in W.H.O. Vaccine Project

I was kind of frozen up.” Reade said that she pulled away and Biden looked “shocked and surprised,” and replied, “Come on, man, I heard you liked me.” Reade, who was a staff assistant in Biden’s office at the time, said she wasn’t aware of any direct witnesses to the encounter. She told the AP she did raise accusations of sexual harassment, but not assault, against Biden in multiple meetings with her supervisors, including Marianne Baker, Biden’s executive assistant; Dennis Toner, Biden’s deputy chief of staff; and Ted Kaufman, the senator’s chief of staff. In a statement provided by the campaign, Baker said that in the nearly two decades she worked for Biden, “I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period — not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone.” Gov.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Sought Biden’s ‘Counsel’ on Coronavirus Response,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has admitted that she has sought Joe Biden’s “counsel” about how to deal with the coronavirus response. In an interview with Politico on Monday, Whitmer said that she spoke with Biden on how to effectively communicate her state’s lockdown measures to the public.  “I’ve had a good relationship with the vice president,” Whitmer told Anna Palmer and Jake Sherman. “He came and helped me a bit when I was running for governor. We’re cut from a similar cloth.” “He’s regularly checking in with me about what’s going on here in Michigan, and what do we need. I’ve gotten some counsel from him in terms of, you know, just trying to communicate to people what we’re confronting, the seriousness of it,” Whitmer admitted. WATCH: Breitbart.com reports: The Detroit News reported on April 21st that Whitmer had retained the services of Chris Meagher, who most recently served as press secretary for Pete Buttigieg’s failed presidential campaign. “We decided to bring Chris on as a temporary (1099) employee to assist us with national press and work with MDHHS on messaging,” Whitmer spokeswoman Tiny Brown told the paper. “He’s not a full-time state employee at this time and doesn’t have a title.” Brown said Meagher would be helping Whitmer for “at least another few weeks.” NASA Warns Of Two ‘Potentially Hazardous’ Asteroids Heading This Way In May Pelosi Endorses Biden Despite Credible Sex Assault Claims: ‘the Personification of Integrity’ 
			 "
NASA Warns Of Two ‘Potentially Hazardous’ Asteroids Heading This Way In May,"NASA is warning about not one but two potentially hazardous asteroids due to come our way next month.   There is already a mountain-sized asteroid currently zooming in Earth’s direction.  The gigantic space rock called 1998 OR2, is set to have its closest flyby of our planet in at  least a century when it safely passes Earth at a distance of 6.3  million kilometers (around four million miles) on April 29.    And after that relatively close encounter we can  look forward to two Apollo-class asteroids in the following weeks.   RT reports: Of the pair expected in May, the first is the Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA) 2009 XO.  Estimates
 based on how much light it reflects indicate the space rock is most 
likely the size of a football field, and traveling at a speed of 
45,720kph (28,409mph). The rocky object orbits the Sun every 926 
days and is a member of the Apollo-class of asteroids whose orbits cross
 that of Earth’s, thus giving the experts responsible for planetary 
defense at NASA something to constantly worry about.   Thankfully,
 2009 XO is due to pass our planet at a distance of about 3.3 million 
kilometers on May 7 – which is still considered ‘close’ by NASA’s 
standards.  Providing it doesn’t break up before then, the space  rock is due to make a dozen near-Earth flybys in the next 200 years, the  closest of which will take place on May 7, 2096, when it will come  within 1.5 million kilometers of Earth (for comparison, the Moon sits  384,400 km away).  Lest anyone get too comfy in the near term, however, 2009 XO will be  followed two weeks later by Asteroid 136795 (1997 BQ), which is roughly  twice the size of the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building.  This
 behemoth is also an Apollo-class asteroid and orbits the Sun every 844 
days. Traveling at a comparatively paltry 42,048kph, it’s expected to 
fly past the Earth on May 21 at a distance of 6.2 million kilometers. WHO Chief Says The world Should Have ‘Listened Carefully’ To The Agency’s Coronavirus Warnings In January Gov. Gretchen Whitmer Sought Biden’s ‘Counsel’ on Coronavirus Response 
			 "
WHO Chief Says The world Should Have ‘Listened Carefully’ To The Agency’s Coronavirus Warnings In January,"The World Health Organizaions director general has criticised the world for ‘not listening carefully’  to the agency’s warnings about the coronavirus back in January. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the UN agency had sounded the highest level of  alarm over Covid-19 at the end of January, but not all countries  heeded its advice.  “On January 30 we declared the highest level of global emergency on  Covid-19….. During that time, as you may remember, there were only 82  cases outside China. No cases in Latin America or Africa, only 10 cases  in Europe. No cases in the rest of the world. So the world should have  listened to the WHO then carefully,” the WHO chief said at a virtual press briefing on Monday.  RT reorts: He added that the countries which followed the WHO’s advice – by  extensively testing their populations and implementing contact-tracing  technologies – are “in a better position than others,” but that the WHO only operates in an advisory capacity and cannot mandate governments to follow its recommendations. However, even as the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”
 on January 30, critics were already arguing that the declaration was 
too late and didn’t convey the seriousness of the looming pandemic. 
Moreover, Tedros’ organization assured the public less than two weeks 
earlier that the virus couldn’t pass from person to person, and even as 
infections soared in late January and early February, the WHO insisted 
that travel bans – particularly those affecting China – were “ineffective” and promoted “stigma.” On
 the world stage, US President Donald Trump has been one of the loudest 
critics of the WHO. Trump has accused the organization of “severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of coronavirus” and made the decision to withdraw US funds indefinitely.  Trump’s response has also been criticized, however. Though he 
implemented a partial China travel ban on January 31, Trump’s opponents 
say he repeatedly ignored briefings from the intelligence community about the scale of the outbreak, telling the public even in late February that “the coronavirus is very much under control in the USA.” Trump has also been slammed for his government’s delay in rolling out the “millions” of tests promised in early March. Of
 course, his is not the only administration criticized for its 
coronavirus blunders. In the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been 
flayed in the media for his initial dismissal of the threat. The UK 
lagged behind its European neighbors in shutting down businesses and 
amenities, while Johnson himself insisted on shaking hands long after 
leaders around the world advised against the practice. The British 
government at one point mulled a “herd immunity” strategy, which would have seen the population exposed en masse to the virus. Accused Rapist Released From Jail By Gov.

McGowan has now added her voice to the #DropOutBiden movement, demanding this weekend that sexual predator Biden quit the race.  “Fellow citizens, use your power, use your social media voice,” McGowan tweeted Saturday. “Tweet at Joe Biden to end his campaign effective immediately.” In her explosive statement, McGowan called out Hollywood, the mainstream media, women’s groups, LGBTQ news outlets, and Oprah Winfrey for their continued cover-up of the Biden sexual assault allegations. “Fuck you to the silent media, fuck you to women’s groups, Gloria Steinem, & fucking take ass Oprah, fuck you,” she said. “All of you crow about your braver yet you do nothing.” Fellow citizens, use your power, use your social media voice. RISE. Tweet at JoeBiden to end his campaign effective immediately. Citizens, free yourselves. Overthrow a sick system run by false prophets. This is the moment. BECAUSE WE CAN. See below. #powertothepeople pic.twitter.com/MjNe2C8Ddn Breitbart.com reports:  Tara Reade’s allegation that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993 has gained momentum in recent days after an old Larry King Live segment from CNN resurfaced showing Reade’s mother referencing her daughter’s experience during a call. The footage corroborates Tara Reade’s claim that she told her mother about the alleged incident. In the last month, Rose McGowan has used her massive social media following to keep Reade’s story alive, lambasting media outlets like the New York Times that provided virtually non-stop coverage of Brett Kavanaugh’s accusers only to marginalize Tara Reade’s story. The actress has called out the Times for its “favoritism” and “utter hypocrisy.” In her Saturday tweet, McGowan stepped up her claims against the newspaper, alleging that the Times deliberately sat on the Reade story until Biden became the presumptive nominee. I’d say ⁦@nytimes⁩ it’s because the public sees your favoritism and your utter hypocrisy. Yes, you go after the reprehensible Trump, but leave Biden accusations alone. You are the problem.  https://t.co/Rm5OiRrOp1 The New York Times stealth edited its recent investigation into Tara Reade, removing a section that painted Biden in an unfavorable light. Breitbart News found that a sentence that previously read “The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden, beyond the hugs, kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable” was scrubbed of its latter half, now reading: “The Times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Biden.” McGowan has also targeted her Charmed co-star Alyssa Milano, recently calling her a “fraud” for continuing to endorse Biden despite the assault accusation. During the Kavanaugh hearings, Milano expressed her support for “Believe Women,” but she recently said that men like Biden now deserve due process when faced with accusations. “You are a lie,” McGowan said in a tweet directed at Milano. “You have always been a lie. The corrupt DNC is in on the smear job of Tara Reade, so are you.” You are a fraud. This is about holding the media accountable. You go after Trump & Kavanaugh saying Believe Victims, you are a lie. You have always been a lie. The corrupt DNC is in on the smear job of Tara Reade, so are you. SHAME https://t.co/B7NHK4k09K Rose McGowan has also gathered support from passionate Bernie bros who have refused to line up obediently behind Biden. The actress has long alleged that Harvey Weinstein raped her but that most of Hollywood ignored her claim for years. In her statement on Saturday, she referred to Weinstein as the “warthog from hell.” The Biden campaign is facing increasing pressure from supporters following Tara Reade’s allegations. The HuffPost reported that sexual assault survivors who were inclined to vote Democrat in November are now thinking twice because of what Reade has claimed.HuffPost said it spoke with 15 survivors of sexual assault about Reade’s allegation and how it affected their view of Biden’s candidacy. The outlet found that almost all believe Reade’s account to be “highly credible.” Some plan to vote for Biden because they see him as the lesser of two evils, according to the HuffPost. Others said they plan to sit out the election while some said any allegation of sexual assault ought to be disqualifying.

Bill Gates Defends Communist China: They “Did a Lot of Things Right” While US Acted “Poorly”,"Pandemic superstar Bill Gates has lashed out against the US response to the coronavirus outbreak, while defending China’s actions, claiming that the communist regime “did a lot of thigns right at the beginning.” Appearing on CNN, Gates gushed that “China did a lot of things right at the beginning,” but added that “Like any country where a virus first shows up, they can look back and see where they missed some things.” I guess silencing whistleblowers and lying about transmissibility count as “right things” in billionaire Bill’s mind.  When CNN host Fareed Zakaria asked Gates what he thinks about China’s lies, the billionaire dismissed it as “a distraction.” WATCH: Bill Gates claims that criticisms of how China lied and covered up the coronavirus is a “distraction”: “China did a lot of things right at the beginning … they avoided the incredible economic pain … I think there’s a lot of incorrect and unfair things said”This is all a lie pic.twitter.com/RlbwV0fUcA “How would you respond to the charge that the Chinese covered this up, they essentially deceived the rest of the world, and as a result, they should be held in someway responsible for this?” Zakaria asked Gates. “Well, I don’t think that’s a timely thing because it doesn’t affect how we act today,” Gates responded. Summit.news reports: In addition, Gates attacked the US government’s response to the outbreak, saying that “Some countries did respond very quickly and get their testing in place and they avoided the incredible economic pain, and its sad that even the US, that you would have expected to do this well, did it particularly poorly.” Gates, who stands to profit in the billions, then urged that the only thing on everyone’s minds now should be “to take the great science we have, the fact that we’re in this together, fix testing and treatments and get that vaccine.” It is obvious that Gates would take this position, given that he basically is the World Health Organisation. The WHO has faced global shame for parroting the dangerous lies of a tyrannical regime, which is still claiming fewer than 5000 deaths in the whole of China from COVID-19. Gates’ foundation is now the WHO’s biggest patron, since the US halted all funding to the organisation. While most expressed disgust at Gates’ comments, China enjoyed the interview, and immediately used it as propaganda: Chinese state propagandists promoting @BillGates defense of the Chinese government. https://t.co/EvqXJuwvfw “Total Fraud – a Setup”: General Flynn to Be “Completely Exonerated” This Week, Says Maria Bartiromo Rose McGowan Calls on ‘Sexual Predator’ Joe Biden to Drop out Following Tara Reade Allegation

Attorney Sidney Powell has been fighting to get her hands on the Brady Material since she took over the case. The documents are filed under seal, but attorney Sidney Powell said it reveals Flynn did not commit any crimes. Powell also said that the documents produced found further misconduct by Mueller’s thug prosecutor Brandon Van Grack specifically. General Flynn was set up by Obama’s Deep State crooks. The Deep State hunted down General Flynn and leaked his December 2016 phone calls with Russian Ambassador Kislyak to the Washington Post in order to oust him as NatSec Advisor. Mueller and his team of thugs prosecuted Flynn and threatened to jail his son if he didn’t plead guilty so he was hit with one count of lying to the feds — but he never lied. President Trump recently floated the idea of pardoning General Flynn. Flynn fired off a tweet on Friday declaring his innocence.

			 "
New Jersey School Teacher Caught Telling Students She Hopes They DIE From Coronavirus for Playing Outside,"A High School teacher from New Jersey was caught on camera telling students who were playing football in the park that they should “die a long, painful death” from the coronavirus.  The woman in the video, Nicole Griggs, has been a teacher in the district for over 15 years. One of the students at Steinert High School where Griggs works says he was confronted by her while playing football with friends on Thursday.  They captured the incident and posted it to Snapchat and TikTok with the caption, “Y’all Mrs Griggs is losing her damn mind how tf is she a teacher #coronavirus.” Government school teacher (to students):""I hope both of you get the coronavirus. I hope you both die a long painful death."" pic.twitter.com/8nSFGYiXUP Thegatewaypundit.com reports: Griggs began by warning them that they could get in trouble being out, but as she became more aggressive, she told the kids that she doesn’t care if her meltdown is posted online. “Parks closed. The whole area,” Griggs says. “Get it through your thick head. You are the reason we are in this situation. You are the problem, not the solution. Go ahead keep recording. Who are you going to show it to? Post me on social media. You’re the idiot doing the wrong thing. I’m just trying to save your ass and save your life. But die, OK. I hope both of you get the coronavirus. I hope you both die a long, painful death.” The students agreed they shouldn’t have been out, and went home afterwards, but were shocked by the teacher’s words. “When she said that, I was shocked,” the Steinert student said. “I didn’t know someone would say something like that, especially a teacher. She should be smarter with her words.” The Trentonian reports that this isn’t the first time Griggs has wished death on people for not following the social distancing orders. They uncovered an April 6 post on Facebook by a woman named “Nikki Leigh” that appears to be an alias for Griggs. She wrote, “we are surrounded by idiots!!!!!! Rode our bikes near Kuser Park this afternoon and what to [sic] we see but a younger couple with their daughter maybe 2/3 years old UNDOING the caution tape around the jungle gym so she could slide. I totally called them out on it, wished illness on them and commented that it was scary to even think they were parents. Their response: ‘We were going to put it back.’” Mayor Jeff Martin condemned the teacher’s actions, but it remains unclear if she will keep her job. “This is a very serious thing,” he said. “We’ve got at least 50 people who have actually died from it, 50 families. It’s not something to joke around about. Teacher or not, it’s unacceptable.” The school’s superintendent Scott Rocco has said he is investigating the incident. Murder and Burglary SOARS in Cuomo’s New York Amid Lockdown “Total Fraud – a Setup”: General Flynn to Be “Completely Exonerated” This Week, Says Maria Bartiromo 
			 "
Murder and Burglary SOARS in Cuomo’s New York Amid Lockdown,"While New York City remains under strict lockdown under Gov. Cuomo’s orders due to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak, major violent crime has soared to dangerous levels.  Cuomo issued the stay-at-home orders on March 20 that forced the closure of most businesses, except those deemed “essential,” in an effort to thwart the spread of the coronavirus. Even with the lockdown, major crime categories such as murder and burglary have risen across the city.  Over the last 28 days, murders in New York City have risen over 55 percent compared to the same time last year.  Breitbart.com reports: Between April 13 to April 19, murders increased 100 percent compared to the same week last year. From year-to-date, murders are up by 5.7 percent. Likewise, grand larceny auto — a crime that no longer warrants bail in New York — has increased more than 53 percent compared to last year. Specifically, there have been 500 charges for auto theft in the last 28 days. During that same time in 2019, there were 326 charges for auto theft. Over the last week, grand larceny auto crimes across the city have jumped 50.5 percent and they are up more than 62 percent overall since the year before — the largest spike in crime year-to-date for any major category. The lockdown has also not stopped the rise of burglary in New York City — another crime that in many cases allows the suspect to be released from jail without ever paying bail. Burglaries are up by 25 percent in the last 28 days and up by more than 36 percent in the last week. From January 1 to April 19, burglaries are up 27.1 percent compared to this same time last year. NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea told local media that burglary suspects are getting “released immediately” from jail due to existing bail laws. Though other crimes — such as rape, felony assault, and grand larceny — have brought down the total number of major crimes committed in New York City during the lockdown by 32.6 percent, overall crime is still up 4.6 percent year-to-date. The lockdown has dwindled the number of shootings and shooting victims in New York City but the overall year-to-date totals are still up. For instance, the number of shooting victims from January 1 to April 19 has increased 5.5 percent and total shootings have increased 4.1 percent compared to last year. At the beginning of the year, Cuomo implemented bail reform laws that eliminated bail for suspects accused of second-degree manslaughter, aggravated vehicular assault, third-degree assault, promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, criminally negligent homicide, aggravated vehicular homicide, and about 100 other crimes. Simultaneously, Cuomo has ordered the release of thousands of inmates across New York to ensure prisons are abiding by social distancing guidelines. The New York Post has reported that at least 50 of the 1,500 inmates released in New York City have been rearrested for crimes. Victims Lawyers Are Demanding Jeffrey Epstein’s Estate Hands Over Prince Andrew Evidence New Jersey School Teacher Caught Telling Students She Hopes They DIE From Coronavirus for Playing Outside 
			 "
Victims Lawyers Are Demanding Jeffrey Epstein’s Estate Hands Over Prince Andrew Evidence,"Lawyers for victims of Jeffrey Epstein are demanding evidence from the late pedophile’s executors that they believe may incriminate Prince Andrew. The huge tranche of evidence includes emails, photos and surveillance footage. The Mail On Sunday reports: In court papers lodged last week, they have  demanded that Epstein’s estate hand over any photographs of the Duke,  who was friends with the shamed multi-millionaire financier for more  than a decade. The 21-page ‘request for  production’ document filed at the federal court in New York asks for  ‘all written or electronic correspondences’ between Epstein and Andrew,  details of the Duke’s visits to the paedophile’s homes and any evidence  that he engaged in sexual activity or massages while at them.  It also asks: ‘Did the surveillance in place at Jeffrey Epstein’s home  have recording capabilities? If so, please state whether  the recordings could be viewed live, where the live feed could be viewed  from, where the recordings were stored historically, where the  recordings are currently stored, which person or entity has possession  or control of the recordings.’  Epstein is known to have installed cameras
 in his homes with speculation that he stored any compromising footage. 
While it is not known if any such evidence exists, the document 
illustrates the zeal with which Epstein’s victims are pursuing the 
Queen’s second son, who has strongly rejected any allegations of 
wrongdoing. The document was filed by 
Brad Edwards, the lawyer for Virginia Roberts who claims that she was 
coerced by Epstein into having sex with the Duke on three occasions, the
 first in London when she was 17. Prince Andrew denies her claims. Mr
 Edwards has pursued Epstein for 12 years, extracting thousands of pages
 of damning evidence against him. The latest move suggests he is 
pursuing the same strategy against Prince Andrew. The  submission was made in the case of an anonymous woman, ‘Priscilla Doe’,  who is pursuing the millionaire’s executors. She claims she was 20 when  Epstein offered to help with her dancing career, but instead coerced  her into performing sex acts for his friends.  As well as the Duke, the request extends 
to several of Epstein’s other associates including US President Donald 
Trump, Bill Clinton, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Les 
Wexner, the former owner of the Victoria’s Secret lingerie brand. None 
of them has ever been charged with any offence and each denies any 
wrongdoing. The document lists the dates when Andrew was allegedly at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion, private  island in the Caribbean and ranch in New Mexico. It asks ‘whether or not  [Andrew] received a massage at any property owned or controlled by  Jeffrey Epstein’ and ‘whether or not [Andrew] engaged in any sexual act  while at any of Jeffrey Epstein’s properties’.  It also requests any photographs of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British  socialite who is accused of being Epstein’s ‘madam’, and any of her  employment and payment records. Ms Maxwell, the daughter of late  newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell, denies any wrongdoing.   Epstein hanged himself in his prison cell last August while awaiting  trial on sex trafficking charges. Lawyers for the victims are currently  negotiating a compensation scheme with his estate, valued at more than  £500 million.  Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing five of 
Epstein’s victims, said she wants the option to sue the Duke as part of 
any deal and is ‘certainly not willing to release Prince Andrew’ from 
any liability. David Boies, who 
represents five other women, including Miss Roberts, previously said he 
will not let ‘certain individuals’ escape liability, naming Andrew in 
court papers as one example.  US Will Not Be Taking Part in WHO Covid-19 Vaccine Initiative Murder and Burglary SOARS in Cuomo’s New York Amid Lockdown 
			 "
US Will Not Be Taking Part in WHO Covid-19 Vaccine Initiative,"World leaders have pledged to accelerate the development, production and distribution of drugs and vaccines against the coronavirus, but the United States will not be taking part.   A spokesman for the U.S. mission in Geneva told Reuters  “there will be no US official participation” in the programme which aims to speed the development of a vaccine and share resources in the fight against the covid-19. He said: “We look forward to learning more about this initiative in support of international cooperation to develop a vaccine  for COVID-19 as soon as possible.”  The Independent reports: The nation’s withdrawal from collaborative international efforts in the wake of the pandemic follows Donald Trump’s  announcement that the US would suspend funding to the WHO after he accused the United Nations agency of “covering up” the  coronavirus outbreak from China.  He attacked the organisation as he  faced similar criticisms after reports showed that he had dismissed or  ignored warnings about the threat of the outbreak from his  administration for several weeks. A global initiative to accelerate the development of a potential vaccine was launched by French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, among other world leaders, on Friday. President Macron told the meeting that the group hopes to “reconcile 
around this joint initiative both China and the US, because this is 
about saying the fight against Covid-19 is a common human good and there
 should be no division in order to win this battle.” The group has pledged to provide access to treatment and vaccines
 to other nations, commit to the international partnership and 
share research efforts and make informed group decisions about their 
response.   WHO Warns There Is No Evidence Of Coronavirus Immunity Victims Lawyers Are Demanding Jeffrey Epstein’s Estate Hands Over Prince Andrew Evidence 
			 "
WHO Warns There Is No Evidence Of Coronavirus Immunity,"The World Health Organization is warning that there is no evidence of coronavirus immunity. In a statement on Saturday the health body, whose largest donor is now Bill Gates, said: “there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID19 and have antibodies are protected from a  second infection” “People  who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have  received a positive test result may ignore public health advice” the statement added.  AOL reports: It also advised against the use of so-called “immunity passports,”  which have been mooted in some countries as a way to enable people to  travel or return to work on the assumption that they are immune to the  virus. At this point in the pandemic, the WHO said, there is not 
enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to
 guarantee the accuracy of such passports or “risk-free” immunity 
certificates. Most people who are infected with COVID-19 will  develop an antibody response that will provide “some level of  protection,” it later clarified, but it does not yet know what that  level is or how long the immunity will last. “It’s  surprising, but it’s not surprising,” said Joseph Fair, a virologist  and NBC News science contributor. “With most viruses, you do get some  kind of immunity, so it’d be surprising if there is no immunity from it,  but only time will tell us what type of immunity you have from COVID-19  if you have recovered and how long that will last.” The WHO warning comes as the worldwide death toll for the coronavirus
 surpassed 200,000 on Saturday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins 
University, with the total number of confirmed cases worldwide now 
standing at nearly 2.9 million. #DropOutBiden Goes Viral, Fuelled by Liberals and #MeToo Supporters US Will Not Be Taking Part in WHO Covid-19 Vaccine Initiative

"#DropOutBiden Goes Viral, Fuelled by Liberals and #MeToo Supporters","The hashtag #DropOutBiden went viral on Twitter on Saturday, fuelled by liberals and #MeToo supporters calling on Joe Biden to drop out fo the 2020 race amid credible sexual assault allegations being made against him.  Although staunch supporters of Biden tried their usual trick of blaming the hashtag on Russian bots, a larger number of prominent liberals were using the hashtag, including Peter Daou, a former Hillary Clinton adviser.  DIFFICULT THREAD — #BIDEN SHOULD WITHDRAW1. I respect the will of the voters.2. But new information has emerged supporting #TaraReade's account of being sexually assaulted by #JoeBiden.3. Credible rape accusations are disqualifying or we have NO moral standards. A large number of those tweeting the hashtag also included supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).  The hashtag coincided with the emergence of a video clip of Biden accuser Tara Reade’s mother. The 1993 clip from Larry King Live featured Reade’s mother calling in to the show from San Luis Obispo. On the show, she complains that her daughter had just worked for a “prominent senator” and had a story to tell but did not want to go to the press out of respect for the senator. The Biden campaign has denied the sexual assault and declined to comment on the Larry King Live video to CNN. D.A.R.E. Cop Arrested for Running Massive Pedophile Ring WHO Warns There Is No Evidence Of Coronavirus Immunity 
			 "
D.A.R.E. Cop Arrested for Running Massive Pedophile Ring,"A highly regarded police officer from Colorado has been arrested for running a massive pedophile ring. Parents whose children participated in the Drug Abuse Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program in Beavercreek, Colorado, are now furious after learning that their children may have had contact with former Beavercreek police officer Kevin A. Kovacs. On Thursday, Kovacs, 58, was arrested at his home for producing, distributing, receiving, transporting and possessing child pornography on a huge scale. “Kevin A. Kovacs, a former longtime Beavercreek police officer, was arrested this morning on federal charges of producing, distributing, receiving, transporting and possessing child pornography,” said U.S. Attorney David M. DeVillers.  “Additionally, Kovacs is charged with tampering with a witness or informant,” a statement from the US Attorney’s office in the Southern District of Ohio states. Less than two years before Kovacs was arrested for running a child porn ring, he received the prestigious “Law Enforcement Officer of the Year” Award. When presented with the honor, the Beavercreek police department praised him for his work with young children: “Officer Kovacs has served the community of Beavercreek for 25 years.  Currently in his sixth year as the D.A.R.E. officer for Beavercreek schools, Officer Kovacs teaches 5th grade students decision-making skills to help them lead safe and healthy lives,  empowering them to respect others and choose to lead lives free from violence, substance abuse, and other dangerous behaviors.  As the crime prevention specialist, Officer Kovacs provides information to citizens and businesses on safety and security issues and assists in developing crime prevention initiatives in the community.  Officer Kovacs’ commitment and dedication to working in partnership with our community and helping to educate the youth of Beavercreek inspires respect for law enforcement and fosters the well-being of the community.“ Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: Kovacs retired in August 2018 after 25 years with the Beavercreek Police Department. He worked as a patrol officer, crime prevention specialist and DARE officer with Beavercreek City Schools, according to a Beavercreek police Facebook post announcing his retirement. It is highly unlikely that this officer, who worked around young children for nearly a decade, just decided to get into child porn after his retirement. Officials are now encouraging anyone who may have had inappropriate contact with the officer to come forward. If you have information related to this case, contact the FBI at 513-421-4310 or the Fairborn Police Department at 937-343-8854. Also, it appears that the officer had been under investigation for some time prior to last week’s arrest. According to News Center 7, they were at Kovacs’ Fairborn home in December, when Fairborn police were assisting with a search warrant. At the time, police declined to comment on the nature of their investigation. “The conduct he is alleged to have committed is both disgusting and extremely disappointing,” said Beavercreek Police Chief Dennis Evers. “As a former D.A.R.E. officer who received departmental and community awards for his work, he, of all people, knew this criminal activity to be exploitation of children and unlawful.” The school system — who put this man in front of countless potential victims, expressed their shock after Kovacs’ arrest. “Beavercreek City Schools administration was alarmed after learning of the allegations against Ofc. Kovacs,” said Beavercreek Superintendent Paul Otten. “School staff and parents have been notified about this alleged incident and are encouraged to reach out to local law enforcement if they have specific concerns or information related to this case.” According to WHIO, Evers also added that this type of activity is part of a larger problem in today’s society and he’s encouraging legislatures to look at passing more stringent laws that would make it more difficult to access this kind of material on the internet. He also is calling for the increasing of penalties who chose to knowingly access and download the material. Pelosi Brutally Slammed After Claiming Trump Told Americans to ‘Inject Lysol Into Their Lungs’ #DropOutBiden Goes Viral, Fuelled by Liberals and #MeToo Supporters 
			 "
Pelosi Brutally Slammed After Claiming Trump Told Americans to ‘Inject Lysol Into Their Lungs’,"Nancy Pelosi took a seriously nasty pop shot at President Trump on Friday, accusing him of instructing Americans to inject Lysol into their lungs. “The president is asking people to inject Lysol into their lungs and Mitch [McConnell] was saying that states should go bankrupt. It’s a clear… visible within 24 hours of how the Republicans reject science and reject governance,” Pelosi said during the Friday presser.  “Clearly and sadly, this president is not listening to medical experts.” Later, towards the end of the presser, the nasty House Speaker declared: “No money for the Post Office. Instead, inject Lysol into your lungs.” WATCH: “Queen Nancy Pelosi can’t land a zinger on Donald Trump without deliberately misquoting him,” Twitchy’s headline said. “Unlike Nancy Pelosi, whose doctor apparently told her to tell people to go to Chinatown as COVID19 was spreading.” Daily Wire’s Ben Shapiro destroyed the Speaker by tweeting: “No money for small businesses. Instead, eat artisanal ice cream.” No money for small businesses. Instead, eat artisanal ice cream. https://t.co/sQkNnxJ4Zz “She’s a ridiculous person. Trump didn’t tell people to inject Lysol, and McConnell said that if states racked up tens of billions in debts unrelated to coronavirus, it is absolutely not the federal government’s responsibility to bail them out. But slay queen, or whatever,” Shapiro continued. She's a ridiculous person. Trump didn't tell people to inject Lysol, and McConnell said that if states racked up tens of billions in debts unrelated to coronavirus, it is absolutely not the federal government's responsibility to bail them out. But slay queen, or whatever. https://t.co/lHr6cZY8C8 Madworldnews.com reports: Guy Benson, Editor at Town Hall, also crushed poor Nancy: “Two dumb distortions, despite irresponsible rantings from POTUS. McConnell is the last adult in the room.” Two dumb distortions, despite irresponsible 🤡 rantings from POTUS. McConnell is the last adult in the room. https://t.co/HLrkXAg5JA “Do any of these Democrats and press understand what chemotherapy and radiation is injected into people every day?” tweeted “Clouseau.” Do any of these Democrats and press understand what chemotherapy and radiation is injected into people every day? This Lysol reference got so crazy, the company that makes the disinfectant came out with a warning. “The parent company of Lysol and another disinfectant warned Friday that its products should not be used as an internal treatment for the coronavirus,” Breitbart reports.  Trump noted Thursday that researchers were looking at the effects of disinfectants on the virus and wondered aloud if something similar could be injected into people, saying the virus “does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it would be interesting to check that.” That prompted a strong warning from the maker of disinfectants Lysol and Dettol, which said it was issuing a statement to combat “recent speculation.” “As a global leader in health and hygiene products, we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route),” said the statement from Reckitt Benckiser. Researchers are testing the effect of disinfectants on virus-laden saliva and respiratory fluids in the laboratory, said William Bryan, of the Department of Homeland Security. They kill the virus very quickly, he said. “And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” Trump said. “Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So, that, you’re going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds — it sounds interesting to me.” The press attacked President Trump once again after Nancy Pelosi’s remarks.  Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asked the president to clarify whether he was encouraging Americans to ingest disinfectants, and Trump replied, “No, of course not.” While Pelosi and her cohorts jumped on the bandwagon to make the crazy accusation that the president told Americans to inject Lysol, they are the ones who are looking mean-spirited and petty during a national emergency. Doctors who specialize in cancer can verify that chemo-therapy is the process of injecting toxic substances into their patients hoping to kill the cancerous cells. The side effects are brutal as they also destroy good cells in the process. Radiation therapy is the same thing. So, maybe Speaker Pelosi should learn a lesson with her grandstanding. Americans will never support any politician who is belittling the man who is clearly doing everything he can to get this country through a horrible situation. Soros-Funded David Brock Group Accused of Violating Tax Laws D.A.R.E. Cop Arrested for Running Massive Pedophile Ring 
			 "
Soros-Funded David Brock Group Accused of Violating Tax Laws,"The David Brock-founded far-left group ‘American Bridge 21st Century probably violated its tax-exempt status by engaging in political activities while illegally posing as a nonprofit, according to a complaint filed Thursday with the Internal Revenue Service.  The Patriots Foundation filed a complaint with the IRS claiming that the Soros-funded group is largely a political organization and therefore has violated U.S. tax laws.  “American Bridge has a super-PAC arm that can spend unlimited sums to influence elections. But the primary purpose of nonprofits organized under section 501(c)4 of the tax code like American Bridge cannot be politics. The complaint quotes material given to potential donors to the nonprofit arm in 2017 saying the organization’s mission is ‘to take on Donald Trump,’” Bloomberg reports. David Brock is a notorious Clinton operative who runs Media Matters for America – another Soros-funded group tasked with censoring social media of conservative and independent voices.  Brock once boasted about lying in a book in order to ruin Anita Hill’s credibility on behalf of the Clintons.  “Groups like American Bridge do not have to disclose their donors, which is why they are sometimes called ‘dark money,’” Bloomberg wrote in their report.  Foxnews.com reports: Liberal billionaire George Soros has been a prominent donor to American Bridge 21st Century and the group spends millions on ads attacking President Trump. The complaint accused American Bridge 21st Century Foundation of engaging in “serious and deliberate violations of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“IRC”) and abused its tax-exempt status” and outlined specific examples, referring to the far-left group as “AB21CF” throughout. “Specifically, as detailed below, AB21CF is not operated exclusively for an exempt- purpose; is operated primarily for political purposes; has participated in an impermissible excess benefit transaction with its founder David Brock and True Blue Media LLC; has provided an improper private benefit to Brock and True Blue; has used its income and assets for the personal gain of Brock; and has engaged in commercial, for-profit business activity through its investment in True Blue Media,” the complaint said. The complaint said “AB21CF appears to have abandoned any attempts at credibly describing itself as a social welfare organization under section 501(c)(4). Instead, it has become singularly focused on one mission, ‘to take on Donald Trump.’” The lengthy document claimed the group planned to create “a 47-person war room to take on Donald Trump with a staff of 23 researchers, a communications team of 16” who feed work to the press for the purposes of rapid-response. “This is not a proper nonprofit purpose,” the complaint said. “The IRS should undertake an examination of AB21CF to determine the extent to which it has misused its tax-exempt status.” The complaint concluded: “Further, the IRS should determine that AB21CF has engaged in egregious and systemic violations of its tax-exempt status, and take appropriate action as warranted including, but not limited to: revoking its tax- exempt status… imposing any appropriate penalties and additions to tax; and referring violations to the Department of Justice for possible criminal prosecution. The Patriots Foundation also filed similar complaints against Media Matters For America and The Franklin Education Forum. American Bridge president Bradley Beychok dismissed any wrongdoing by the far-left group. “The Patriots Foundation has chosen to purposely mislead the public in order to further its right wing agenda,” Beychok told Bloomberg. “He added that Brock resigned from the organization in 2016, before the transfers to True Blue Media were made, and that the group’s board of directors determined the investment would further the mission of American Bridge,” Allison added. Nasty Nancy: Democrats Will Hold Hearing on Dismissal of Dr. Rick Bright – “This Is EXPLOSIVE” Pelosi Brutally Slammed After Claiming Trump Told Americans to ‘Inject Lysol Into Their Lungs’

Nasty Nancy: Democrats Will Hold Hearing on Dismissal of Dr. Rick Bright – “This Is EXPLOSIVE”,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has warned that Democrats will hold a hearing about the dismissal of Dr. Rick Bright, the Trump administration’s vaccine expert who alleges he was removed from his post due to his opposition to the promotion of hydroxychloroquine to treat the Chinese coronavirus. Appearing on MSNBC, Pelosi boasted that Democrats are hellbent on holding President Trump to account.  WATCH: Transcript of interview: ANDREA MITCHELL: Madame Speaker, when [President Donald Trump] suggested yesterday — he said, “We’ll have a cure soon,” but at the same time, according to an upcoming whistleblower complaint that we understand from Dr. [Rick] Bright, who was removed from his position in charge of the vaccination research effort, that he’s actually — according to this complaint and his version of it — he was removed from his job by pushing back against the recommendation from the president, the push to validate that malaria medication. HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI: My colleague Congresswoman Anna Eshoo of California is the chair of the health subcommittee of energy and commerce. It was her legislation that established part of that, that Dr. Bright was the head of. She and we all have respected and know his work and respected over time, and follow that work. She will be — I understand — will be having a hearing on the subject. And — and we have to get to the facts, as allegations are made. But this is — this is explosive. But again, we want to be hopeful for the American people and to kind of, along minimize the impact of what the president is saying. When he takes scientists out because they’re not quickly giving approvals to his preferred choice of medicines, that is a danger to our system.

China Sends Doctors to North Korea Amid Rumors That Kim Jong Un Is Dead or Gravely Ill,"China has dispatched a team of doctors to North Korea to help determine the health status of North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un. Hong Kong Satellite Television reported that Kim was dead though there has been no confirmation from U.S. sources according to Reuters Vice director of HKSTV Hong Kong Satellite Television Shijian Xingzou said  that a ‘very solid source’  told her that Kim Jong Un had died.  Meanwhile a Japanese media outlet claims that the North Korean leader is in a  ‘vegetative state’ following heart surgery.  According to Fox News, the U.S. government has extensive contingency plans in place for Kim’s eventual death that factor in expectations of a mass-scale humanitarian crisis inside the country.  The Mail Online reports:  The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting  reports about the health of the North Korean leader, with western  outlets unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese  team signaled in terms of Kim’s health.   A report by the weekly Shukan Gendai  in
 Japan claimed on Friday that North Korea’s dictator us currently in a 
‘vegetative state’ after having heart surgery earlier in the month. The  outlet cited a Chinese medic who is believed to have been sent as part  of the team to treat Kim Jong Un after a delay in a simple heart  procedure had left the leader severely ill.  The source cited by the news outlet 
claimed that Jong Un was visiting the countryside when he clutched his 
chest and fell to the ground. A doctor with him at the time is said to 
have  performed CPR on accompanied him to a hospital. While
 there is no official proof of the dictator’s death, the hashtag 
#KimJongUndead was trending on twitter on Friday following the report.  A
 delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party’s 
International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea on 
Thursday, two of the people said. The department is the main Chinese 
body dealing with neighbouring North Korea. The sources declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.  The Liaison Department could not be 
reached by Reuters for comment late on Friday. China’s foreign ministry 
did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday. Daily
 NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Kim was 
recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. It 
cited one unnamed source in North Korea. South
 Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the Liaison 
Department challenged subsequent reports suggesting that Kim was in 
grave danger after surgery. South Korean officials said they had 
detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea. On  Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump also downplayed earlier reports  that Kim was gravely ill. ‘I think the report was incorrect,’ Trump told  reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North  Korean officials. On Friday, a South Korean source told 
Reuters their intelligence was that Kim was alive and would likely make 
an appearance soon. The person said he did not have any comment on Kim’s
 current condition or any Chinese involvement. An
 official familiar with U.S. intelligence said that Kim was known to 
have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously
 ill or unable eventually to reappear in public. A
 U.S. State department spokeswoman had no comment. U.S. Secretary of 
State, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Kim’s health on Fox News after 
Trump spoke said, ‘I don’t have anything I can share with you tonight, 
but the American people should know we’re watching the situation very 
keenly.’ NYC Mayor, Who Banned Easter Church Services, Gives 400K Meals to Muslims Celebrating Ramadan Rob Reiner: ‘I Call on Bush, Obama .. to STOP This Insanity and Save Human Life’ 
			 "
"NYC Mayor, Who Banned Easter Church Services, Gives 400K Meals to Muslims Celebrating Ramadan","New York City socialist Mayor Bill de Blasio, who last month threatened to permanently close churches that do not comply with strict lockdown orders, has announced his administration will provide hundreds of thousands of free halal meals to Muslims celebrating Ramadan in the city. Just weeks after threatening Christians and promising “enforcement agents” would shut down any Easter celebrations breaking lockdown orders, De Blasio described Ramadan as a “profoundly important holiday” and announced the city will feed New York’s Muslims holy meals until late May. The Islamic holy month began Thursday and will run until May 23, and Muslims celebrating in New York City will be gifted with 400,000 halal meals courtesy of the American taxpayer, de Blasio announced. De Blasio’s generosity towards the Muslim community sharply contrasts with his treatment of the city’s Christians amid the coronavirus crisis. In March, the socialist mayor threatened to permanently shutter churches and synagogues, just weeks before Easter and Passover celebrations. Now, de Blasio is literally catering to the city’s Muslims. WesternJournal report: While the mayor and city officials were unprepared for the city’s health crisis and have shown Christians and Jews no sympathy during the related shutdowns, they’re now apparently sponsoring Islam. De Blasio made the Ramadan announcement at a media briefing Thursday in which he lamented that Christians and Jews were unable to celebrate their respective holidays this month. “We all wish that the celebrations of Easter and Passover could have been so different,” he said. The mayor then described Ramadan as a “profoundly important holiday,” before announcing the city will feed New York’s Muslims holy meals until late May. “One of Ramadan’s most noble callings is to feed the hungry. And it’s a crucial part of how the holiday is celebrated, to remember to be there for those in need. And that is now harder than ever,” de Blasio continued. “Obviously, people can’t go to their mosques. In fact, mosques have often been a place that those who were hungry, those who were poor, would know they could go during Ramadan to break the fast,” he said. “They knew there would always be a meal there for them. That’s not going to be true in this season. So, we want to, the city of New York wants to support this community as we’re supporting all communities.” As Muslim New Yorkers prepare to start the holy month of Ramadan tonight, Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city is taking steps to support the Muslim community with Halal food programs.“Over half a million meals will be distributed during Ramadan” for Muslim New Yorkers in need pic.twitter.com/d4PbFtGMa5 It’s nice to see the mayor step up and help a people of devoted faith during their time of worship. But where were New York’s public officials as Christians and Jews attempted to attend church and synagogue services? He was threatening them, and it was just three weeks ago. “So, I want to say to all those who are preparing the potential of religious services this weekend — if you go to your synagogue, if you go to your church and attempt to hold services after having been told so often not to, our enforcement agents will have no choice but to shut down those services,” de Blasio said two weeks before Good Friday. “No faith tradition endorses anything that endangers the members of that faith,” he said. “So, the NYPD, Fire Department, Buildings Department, and everyone has been instructed that if they see worship services going on, they will go to the officials of that congregation, they’ll inform them they need to stop the services and disperse,” he continued. “If that does not happen, they will take additional action up to the point of fines and potentially closing the building permanently,” de Blasio concluded. De Blasio: churches and synagogues that hold worship services may be closed permanently pic.twitter.com/kdUsdbP2YO The mayor made no mention of mosques in those comments. While I am not arguing against feeding anyone in need of a meal during this time of crisis and uncertainty, and recognize that New York undoubtedly has a better hold on its number of cases and hospitalizations than it did a few weeks ago, de Blasio’s sudden goodwill approach toward people of faith reeks of favoritism toward Islam and thus raises questions about its constitutionality. In Lemon v. Kurtzman in 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court established a “Lemon Test” weighing whether acts or policies by government are unconstitutional based on the First Amendment’s prohibiting the establishment of a religion. In order to be constitutional, such a policy must have a nonreligious purpose, not end up promoting or favoring any set of religious beliefs and it must not overly entangle the government with religion, the court ruled. While de Blasio’s contrasting policies for getting people of faith to stay at home during the coronavirus crisis might not end up in court, it would be interesting to hear him explain why he used a stick against Christians and Jews while offering Muslims a carrot.

			 "
Bill Gates Compares Coronavirus Fight To World War Two,"Bill Gates has likened the ‘painful’ coronavirus fight to World War Two saying that effort to beat the disease will ‘define our era’ According to the billionaire philanthropist, the covid-19 pandemic will shape the current generation in the same way World War II shaped an earlier cohort. The Sun reports:  In a lengthy memo published Thursday, the Microsoft co-founder  acknowledged the pain caused by the outbreak which will be felt “for  years to come”.  “It is impossible to overstate the pain that people are feeling now 
and will continue to feel for years to come,” the memo reads. “No one who lives through Pandemic 1 will ever forget it.” Gates likened the coronavirus crisis to a world war with one major difference – “we’re all on the same side,” he said. Politics was notably absent from his memo, which instead focused on  ways to contain the spread of the virus that has killed nearly 50,000 in  the US. Gates highlighted the innovations in “testing, treatments, vaccines 
and policies”, which he said will eventually come to fruition through 
unified effort. He noted how impressed he’s been with “how the world is coming together to fight this fight.” The tech tycoon underscored the importance and effectiveness of 
social distancing, saying: “A lot of people will be stunned that in many
 places we will go from hospitals being overloaded in April to having 
lots of empty beds in July.” But America shouldn’t be reopened as life slowly goes back to normal –  some places could have a “stutter” in cases as others deal with  “persistent clusters of infection”, Gates said 
A return to normalcy would depend on innovation in four areas: 
treatments, faster and improved testing, contact tracing, and vaccines.
 “If in the spring of 2021 people are going to big public events – 
like a game or concert in a stadium – it will be because we have a 
miraculous treatment that made people feel confident about going out 
again,” he said. New Evidence Supports Tara Reade’s Sexual Assault Claim Against Biden Robert F Kennedy Jr: False ‘Savior’ Bill Gates Now Controls The Lives Of 7 Billion Humans 
			 "
New Evidence Supports Tara Reade’s Sexual Assault Claim Against Biden,"A credible new piece of evidence has emerged that appears to vindicate Tara Reade’s claim that she was violently sexually assaulted by Joe Biden in 1993.  Biden, through his spokesman, has repeatedly denied the controversial allegations. However, Reade has claimed to various media outlets that she blew the whistle on the assault to her mother, a close friend, and her brother.  Her brother, Collin Moulton, and her friend, both confirmed that they were told about the sexual assault from Reade in the early 90’s.  Reade’s mother died in 2016, but both her brother and friend also confirmed Reade had told her mother, and that her mother urged Reade to go to the police – something that Reade recently did.  Theintercept.com reports: In interviews with The Intercept, Reade also mentioned that her mother had made a phone call to “Larry King Live” on CNN, during which she made reference to her daughter’s experience on Capitol Hill. Reade told The Intercept that her mother called in asking for advice after Reade, then in her 20s, left Biden’s office. “I remember it being an anonymous call and her saying my daughter was sexually harassed and retaliated against and fired, where can she go for help? I was mortified,” Reade told me. Reade couldn’t remember the date or the year of the phone call, and King didn’t include the names of callers on his show. I was unable to find the call, but mentioned it in an interview with Katie Halper, the podcast host who first aired Reade’s allegation. After the podcast aired, a listener managed to find the call and sent it to The Intercept. On August 11, 1993, King aired a program titled, “Washington: The Cruelest City on Earth?” Toward the end of the program, he introduces a caller dialing in from San Luis Obispo, California. Congressional records list August 1993 as Reade’s last month of employment with Biden’s Senate office, and, according to property records, Reade’s mother, Jeanette Altimus, was living in San Luis Obispo County. Here is the transcript of the beginning of the call: KING: San Luis Obispo, California, hello. CALLER: Yes, hello. I’m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in Washington? My daughter has just left there, after working for a prominent senator, and could not get through with her problems at all, and the only thing she could have done was go to the press, and she chose not to do it out of respect for him. KING: In other words, she had a story to tell but, out of respect for the person she worked for, she didn’t tell it? CALLER: That’s true. King’s panel of guests offered no suggestions, and instead the conversation veered into a discussion of whether any of the men on set would leak damaging personal information about a rival to the press. Video👇🏻@ReadeAlexandra — is this your Mom’s voice? https://t.co/ospBhlKSvb pic.twitter.com/r5WsXJ2vQb Reade, after being read the transcript of the call, said that it gelled with her memory of it, and, after the video was surfaced, confirmed it is her mother’s voice on the call. “Aww, I have not heard my mom’s voice in awhile,” she said. There are several notable things about the emergence of the call. On the one hand, the caller does not specifically mention “sexual harassment” or retaliation, as Reade had recalled. On the other hand, the reference to being unable to “get through with her problems” aligns with Reade’s claim that she complained to superiors in Biden’s office and got nowhere, and the reference to going to the press makes clear that the caller is talking about more than just generic problems at the office. The problems, she makes clear, would damage the senator if exposed. Reade’s inability to remember the exact date of the alleged assault, or its precise location, or the precise location of the office where she picked up the form needed to file a complaint, has been used by skeptics to suggest the allegation is fabricated. What the emergence of the call shows is that even if Reade’s memory is off on timing or details, the substance of her claims — in this case, that her mother called Larry King and discussed her situation — can still be true. The call also calls into question the credibility of Biden’s denial. Reade said that she filed a complaint about Biden’s harassment with Marianne Baker, effectively the office manager in the Biden office. The Biden campaign released a statement from Baker, which said that neither Reade nor any other employee had ever complained about improper behavior. “In all my years working for Senator Biden, I never once witnessed, or heard of, or received, any reports of inappropriate conduct, period — not from Ms. Reade, not from anyone,” Baker said in the campaign’s statement. “These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades.” For Baker’s statement to be true, Reade would have had to have lied to her friend, brother, and mother about having complained to Biden’s office. There is no obvious reason Reade would make up a story to those closest to her about the Senate office not taking Biden’s harassment seriously, while at the same time resisting pressure to go to the press. Reade has said that the complaint she filed was related to the harassment she said she faced, and did not address the assault. The complaint was left with Biden’s office, and if it still exists, is with Biden’s papers at the University of Delaware. The school recently told reporter Rich McHugh that the papers are sealed until two years after Biden leaves public life. And @UDelaware — which houses the collection of Joe Biden's senatorial papers — just confirmed to me that the papers ""will remain closed to the public until two years after Mr. Biden retires from public life."" The harassment Reade first went public with last year involves stroking her neck and running his fingers through the curls in her hair, as well as asking her to effectively serve as a cocktail waitress at an event. Reade’s assault allegation, which became public last month, involves an interaction in the spring of 1993. She said that she was sent by her manager to bring a gym bag to Biden, and they met in a hallway of the Russell Senate Office Building, in a tucked away corner. Before she knew it, he pressed her up against the wall, forcibly kissed her, and put a hand each up her blouse and skirt, penetrating her with his fingers. She had what she recalls now as an “absurd” thought. “I remember thinking, where’s the gym bag? Because he had taken it in his hand, but all of a sudden it wasn’t in his hands and his hands were where they weren’t supposed to be,” she said. Reade said that her impression was that Biden believed he had consent, and was surprised at the rejection, but that she had done nothing to give him that impression. “There was no flirtation, he had no consent. He was by my ears when he said, ‘Do you wanna go somewhere else?’” She pushed him off and he stepped back, looking surprised, she recalled, and flashing a huge smile. “‘Come on, man,’” she said he told her. “‘I heard you liked me.’” “He had that smile he gets, but his eyes were not smiling,” she said. “You’re fine,” she recalled he said, grabbing her by her shoulders. As he walked away, he pointed back, “You’re fine.” Rep. Gaetz Accuses Joe Biden of “Simping” for China Bill Gates Compares Coronavirus Fight To World War Two

			 "
Virginia Police Arrest 30 Pedophiles as Part of Operation ‘COVID Crackdown’,"Police in Virginia have arrested thirty dangerous pedophiles as part of a massive anti-child abuse operation named “COVID Crackdown.” The child abusers were caught in just one Virginia county over the course of this month in an undercover sting set up to catch child rapists who target children online.  The investigation, which was designed to protect minors using the internet for online school classes amid the coronavirus lockdown, has seen a total of 68 felony charges put on 30 pedophiles. The pedophiles were initiating “explicit conversations” with police posing as children online before trying to “initiate sex” with them, officers at Fairfax County Police found. The predators were then arrested at the locations they had agreed to meet the ‘underage children,’ who were actually police officers posing as kids.  All 30 men now face more than one count of solicitation of a minor and attempted indecent liberties or soliciting a minor for prostitution.  Daily Mail reports: Major Ed O’Carroll, Bureau Commander of Major Crimes for the department said in a statement: ‘Our detectives have remained vigilant and they recognized the increased threat posed by online predators in recent weeks.’  ‘I commend their ability to adapt during this unprecedented public health pandemic and to do so in the interest of protecting our children and bringing justice to those who commit these repugnant crimes.’   The men arrested were either from Virginia county or had travelled from Maryland, West Virginia or Washington D.C.   More than 50 million children in the United States are at home due to the coronavirus pandemic that forced the shut down of schools, restaurants and bars, and other businesses deemed non-essential. While states are developing plans to slowly reopen, it’s unclear if that will take weeks or months, which means children will likely be at home for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school.  With many taking online classes this could mean they are spending more time on the internet and are therefore more exposed to dangers posed by peodophiles who use the internet to exploit children.

As News Punch previously reported, the campaign calling for an end to Ghebreyesus’s controversial tenure at the W.H.O began on January 31. The Change.org petition entitled, “Call for the resignation of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General,” cites Dr. Tedros’ refusal earlier this year to designate the coronavirus a global health emergency when cases emerged in China.  Breitbart.com reports: An anonymous Taiwan activist using the ID “Osuka Yip” launched the call, reflecting global concerns Tedros has been economical with the truth since the deadly virus it was first isolated in the southern Chinese city of Wuhan last November. Japanese deputy prime minister and finance minister Taro Aso agreed. He said in parliament that some have even started calling the World Health Organization the “Chinese Health Organization,” NHK reported, such has been its inability to do anything other than repeat Chinese diplomatic messaging. “We strongly think Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is not fit for his role as WHO director general. We call for the immediate resignation of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,” the petition states. Such is the clamor of disapproval surrounding the Ethiopian bureaucrat that last week U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a hold on funds sent to the U.N. body, demanding they answer for their failures to properly warn the world about the deadly virus. The president also criticized the W.H.O. for attacking his travel ban on China during the early days of the pandemic: He pointed out the W.H.O. played a role in “mismanaging and covering up” the spread of the coronavirus around the world. “The W.H.O. pushed China’s misinformation about the virus, saying it was not communicable and there was no need for travel bans,” Trump said. On January 14, months after health officials are believed to have detected the first case of the virus in China on November 17 of last year, the W.H.O. was promoting a Chinese claim via Twitter that there was “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” Meanwhile, the disease was spiraling out of control. The W.H.O. tweet came a day before the first case to reach the United States reportedly flew from Wuhan to the state of Washington. This is not the first time Tedros has drawn public criticism in his role. In October 2017, he named former Zimbabwe tyrant Robert Mugabe a “goodwill ambassador” to help combat non-communicable diseases in Africa, provoking outrage from medical professionals and human rights groups. As the New York Times noted: The role of good-will ambassador is largely symbolic, but rights groups were scathing in their reaction to the symbolism of giving it to a man whose leadership, they say, has led to the collapse of its health service and major rights abuses in Zimbabwe. Ultimately, Tedros rescinded his decision to name Mugabe “goodwill ambassador” in the wake of criticism. Meghan McCain: The Worse Unemployment Gets Because of Coronavirus, the More Biden ‘Has to Benefit’ MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace: Coronavirus Has a ‘Silver Lining’ – It Will HURT Trump 
			 "
"Meghan McCain: The Worse Unemployment Gets Because of Coronavirus, the More Biden ‘Has to Benefit’","On Friday’s broadcaset of “The View,” co-host Meghan McCain boasted that more people losing their jobs due to coronavirus would “benefit” Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s campaign.  While the panel was discussing the pandemic preventing Biden from campaigning, Joy Behar noted, “Well, he does need more exposure. I’ll give him that. I mean, this guy is on every night, bloviating for 2, 3 hours, taking questions, making up stories. Biden could use a little air time, and I think that the media should start giving it to him, starting with us. We should have him here on a regular basis. And as far as a vice presidential pick, I think that somebody who’s going to bring the states that he needs is where that has to go, and somebody who we could see as the next president who will continue to bring stability and calmness and empathy to a country that’s in pain basically. I mean, we are in pain right now. And we need somebody to take care of us, and I think that man is Joe Biden.” McCain responded, “I think it’s difficult right now because obviously, his huge strength is his retail politics. I have yet to meet anyone who has met and interacted with this man in person and didn’t come away saying, ‘I may disagree with some of his politics, but he’s a really authentic person.’ That is a huge gift and a huge asset to the Biden campaign, and with the coronavirus, he’s unable to do that right now.” “I do think, you know, he’s talking about announcing his cabinet early, the people he’s going to choose. I think this could be really interesting and provocative because if we all know Joe, and all of us on this show do, I actually think it has the potential to be a really bipartisan cabinet. Again I’m only telling you this as a conjecture of my own beliefs. Nothing I know. That we could see Republicans and Democrats and independents in this cabinet, and I do think to Joy’s point, this country is in a lot of pain, and if there’s one thing that I’m constantly striving for, is for us to be meeting in the middle, celebrating the things that unite us as a country instead of the things that tear us apart,” she continued.  McCain added, “We are in the middle of one of the great crises of my lifetime, and all of our lifetimes. I do think a president who has character and empathy is something that most Americans are longing for, and I think the worse these job numbers get, and the worse the unemployment numbers get, I think the more he has to benefit from this my biggest concern is his inability to campaign right now. There’s nothing we can do about that right now, unless like you pointed out, Joy, is continue to interview him continue to put him on our air as we would any candidate.” MP’s Demand Universal Basic Income Plan For Post-Lockdown UK Petition Demanding W.H.O. Chief Resigns Surpasses ONE MILLION Signatures 
			 "
MP’s Demand Universal Basic Income Plan For Post-Lockdown UK,"More than 100 MP’s in the UK have demanded that a universal basic income is introduced after the lockdown. In a letter to the government, MPs from seven opposition parties asked for the payments to help support those hit hardest by the coronavirus crisis. Published online, the letter calls for a “recovery universal basic income” after concerns that the furlough scheme could not last.  RT reports:  The group admits that the UK is likely facing “a damaging recession, as well as ongoing economic insecurity” and warns of further “economic shocks from financial, climate and pandemic crises over the coming years.”  They argue that “Income protection is too inflexible a tool on an ongoing basis” and add that Universal Credit is already struggling and many are “falling through the cracks.”  Amid a backdrop of uncertain times and the prospect of a “non-uniform” lockdown exit which is likely to take place at “an uneven speed” the MPs call for “a regular cash payment to every individual.” The
 group declined to propose an exact rate or duration for the suggested 
UBI program, deferring those to the government, but stated that it 
should be sufficient to provide economic security and should include an “urgent and significant increase in Child Benefit.” The  group, which includes signatories from Labour, Liberal Democrats, Green  Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru (the party of Wales), and  Northern Ireland’s Social Democratic and Labour Party, claims that “84% of the public now support the introduction of a UBI” in addition to “support from seven parties across all four nations.” “A Universal Basic Income is the simplest way to ensure no one is left behind during the coronavirus crisis,” Ian Blackford, the SNP’s Westminster leader, said. Previously,
 170 members of the British parliament called for unconditional aid for 
the entire duration of the coronavirus crisis but their appeals were 
dismissed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak. Meanwhile, 
luminaries such as Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey donated $1 billion to help 
manage the aftermath of the pandemic by establishing a “universal basic income” while Pope Francis wrote a letter in favor of UBI on Easter Sunday.  Spain
 is the first European country to begin developing some form of 
universal basic income in response to the pandemic and the impending 
economic crisis. The government has already announced the gradual 
introduction of a minimum subsistence income, though the final amount 
has yet to be determined, for all families with an income below €450 per
 month ($488, £395).  Coronavirus Is Chance To Choose ‘New Way Forward’ Says Greta Thunberg Meghan McCain: The Worse Unemployment Gets Because of Coronavirus, the More Biden ‘Has to Benefit’

Coronavirus Is Chance To Choose ‘New Way Forward’ Says Greta Thunberg,"Climate change alarmists are scrambling to link the hysteria surrounding the coronavirus to climate change and sustainable development According to teen activist Greta Thunberg the Covid-19 outbreak shows the need for long-term thinking.     “Whether we like it not the world has changed….and we are going to have to choose a new way forward,” she said. Technocracy news reports: Countries have a chance to choose a new path as societies begin to  return to normal after lockdowns imposed to prevent the spread of the  coronavirus, activist Greta Thunberg told an Earth Day event on  Wednesday.  Thunberg, who shot to fame as a 15-year-old when she started  skipping school on Fridays to protest over carbon emissions outside  Sweden’s parliament building, said the outbreak showed the need for  long-term thinking.  “Whether we like it not the world has changed, it looks  completely different from how it did a few months ago and it will  probably not look the same again and we are going to have to choose a  new way forward,” she said.  “If one single virus can destroy economies in a matter of  weeks, it shows we are not thinking long term and we are not taking  these risks into account.”  She was taking part in a streamed event to mark Earth Day, launched 50 years ago to highlight environmental challenges.  Last year was the hottest on record in Europe, according to a  study released on Wednesday by the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change  Service.  Thunberg’s school strikes calling for climate action sparked a  global movement and transformed the now 17-year-old into the equivalent  of an environmental rock star.  Drawing on her statement to the World Economic Forum last year,  in which she said: “I want you to act as if our house is on fire.  Because it is,” her Fridays for Future movement released a video to mark  Earth Day showing a family carrying out their normal routine, despite  flames licking round their home.  But not everyone agrees with her approach. U.S President Donald  Trump in December urged her to “work on her Anger Management problem,  then go to a good old fashioned movie”.  U.S. May Never Restore Funding For WHO Says Mike Pompeo MP’s Demand Universal Basic Income Plan For Post-Lockdown UK 
			 "
U.S. May Never Restore Funding For WHO Says Mike Pompeo,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States, the World Health Organization’s largest donor, may never restore funding to the United Nations body.    He said a fundamental reform of the  World Health Organization (WHO) was needed following its handling of the coronavirus pandemic adding that ‘this is not the first time we have had to deal with the shortcomings of this organisation’ WND reports:  Pompeo told Fox News late on Wednesday “it may be the case that the  United States can never return to underwriting, having U.S. taxpayer  dollars go to the WHO.”   “I think we need to take a real hard look at the WHO and what we do  coming out of this,” he said in an interview with “The Ingraham Angle.”  “We reformed this back in 2007, so this isn’t the first time we’ve had  to deal with the shortcomings of this organization that sits inside the  United Nations. We need a fix. We need a structural fix with the WHO.”  The president suspended U.S. funding last week after criticizing the 
WHO’s “China-centric” stance, including promotion of China’s 
“disinformation” about the coronavirus. WHO officials have rejected Trump’s criticism. The U.S. has been the largest donor to the WHO, contributing more 
than $400 million in 2019. That’s about one seventh of the entire 
budget. Pompeo said the U.S. “strongly believed” Beijing failed to report the
 outbreak in a timely manner, which is a violation of WHO rules. Pompeo also criticized WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom 
Ghebreyesus for failing to make a public issue of China’s breach of the 
rules. Bill Gates Calls Coronavirus ‘Pandemic 1’ in Memo, Tells People To Get Ready For ‘Years of Pain’ Coronavirus Is Chance To Choose ‘New Way Forward’ Says Greta Thunberg

Airports won’t have large crowds. Sports will be played in basically empty stadiums. And the world economy will be depressed because demand will stay low.” RELATED: Robert F.

NPR: Tom Hanks’ Blood To Be Used In Creation of Coronavirus Vaccine,"Tom Hanks’ blood is set to be used by medical researchers in the creation of a vaccine for coronavirus, according to an NPR podcast.  The Hollywood celebrity spoke about his blood and the creation of the coronavirus vaccine while appearing on NPR’s Wait Wait… Don’t Tell Me! on the weekend.  The married couple were among the first elites to test positive for COVID-19 while in Australia where Hanks was working on Baz Luhrmann’s upcoming Elvis Presley biopic. After going public with their diagnosis and keeping the world updated on their condition while in isolation in Australia, the Hanks made a “full recovery” and were allowed to return to their home in Los Angeles.  Now Hanks has revealed that they have been approached by medical researchers developing a vaccine with a request for their blood.  Hanks joked that if he and his wife’s blood proves to be useful in the fight against coronavirus, then he will be proud of his role in the creation of a ‘Hank-ccine‘. DailyMail report: On the public radio game show he said: ‘We just found out that we do carry the antibodies ‘We have not only been approached; we have said, do you want our blood? Can we give plasma? And, in fact, we will be giving it now to the places that hope to work on what I would like to call the Hank-ccine.’ The Forrest Gump actor previously revealed that his producer-and-actress wife Rita suffered much worse coronavirus symptoms than he did and he was concerned for her health. He said: ‘Rita went through a tougher time than I did. She had a much-higher fever and she had some other symptoms.  ‘She lost her sense of taste and smell. She got absolutely no joy from food for a better part of three weeks. She was so nauseous, she had to crawl on the floor from the bed to the facilities. It lasted a while.’ Now that Tom and Rita are back on their feet, their using their energy to advocate for mail-in voting.  ‘We as Americans and as voters should be able to request the options that work for us,’ Wilson said. ‘We don’t want to have to risk our health or our vote. So to make that easy, mail-in ballot, absentee ballot, I think that’s a really great compromise.‘ Robert F Kennedy Jr: World’s Unelected ‘President’ Bill Gates Is Using Humans As ‘Guinea Pigs’ Bill Gates Calls Coronavirus ‘Pandemic 1’ in Memo, Tells People To Get Ready For ‘Years of Pain’

Kennedy Jr.  “Gates’ strategy of buying WHO [World Health Organization] and purchasing control of US health officials like Tony Fauci & Deborah Birx” means the Microsoft co-founder can now “dictate global health policies affecting 7 billion people and to control the most intimate details of our lives,” said Kennedy Jr. on his Instagram page.

According to @Politico “Gates’ priorities have become the WHO’s. Rather than focusing on strengthening health care in poor countries… the agency spends a disproportionate amount of its resources on projects… Gates prefers” such as GMO crops, chemical agriculture and vaccines. As the @nationmag reported last week, those policies often benefit pharma & chemical companies—like Monsanto—in which Gates and his foundation are heavily invested. Those efforts rob resources from sanitation, hygiene, nutrition & development in favor of vaccine solutions with no proven benefits & no accountability. Gates’ disastrous Polio vaccine program has squandered half WHO’s total budget while spreading vaccine-strain polio epidemics around the globe. WHO reluctantly admits that Gates’s vaccine now causes 70% of global polio cases.  Gates was the first private individual to keynote WHO’s general assembly. He is treated like a head of state, at the WHO & the G20 and by the obsequious international press. A Geneva-based NGO rep complained to Politico: “Few people dare to openly criticize what he does.” Critics deride Gates’ approach as “monopolistic philanthropy.” Under his direction, WHO is conducting global social and medical experimentation applying Gates’ religious faith that he can use technology (vaccines and GMO agriculture) and his deep understanding of computers to make him the savior to all of humanity.

Bin Laden Wanted Biden To Become President Because He Would ‘Plunge US Into Crisis’,"Osama bin Laden planned to assassinate President Barack Obama to unsteady the United States by putting ‘totally unprepared‘ Joe Biden in charge, according to declassified documents seized from Bin Laden’s compound.  The documents from 2011 reveal Bin Laden’s plans to throw the U.S. ‘into a crisis‘ by killing Obama while he traveled in a plane with U.S. military commander David Petraeus. The 45-page document, which was first reported by The Washington Post in 2012, is now available in full along with hundreds of others from the raid. Osama wrote to Al Qaeda deputy Atiyah Abd al-Rahman: ‘The reason for concentrating on them is that Obama is the head of infidelity and killing him automatically will make [Vice President] Biden take over the presidency, Biden is totally unprepared for that post, which will lead the U.S. into a crisis. ‘As for Petraeus, he is the man of the hour … and killing him would alter the war’s path’ in Afghanistan.‘ DailyMail report: Osama’s ambition was to have Ilyas Kasmiri, described by U.S. officials as Al Qaeda’s military operations chief in Pakistan, shoot down the plane carrying Obama. The aspirations never developed into further planning, the U.S. intelligence service told The Washington Post.  Detailing his plans Osama wrote: ‘Please ask brother Ilyas to send me the steps he has taken into that work.’   Kasmiri was killed by a U.S. drone strike shortly after Bin Laden was killed by the U.S. special forces. Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was reportedly killed by a CIA drone strike in August of 2011.        In a description of the tense 2011 strategy session ahead of the raid which killed Bin Laden, told by Biden almost eight years ago during a retreat in Maryland for congressional Democrats, he recalled that he said: ‘Mr. President, my suggestion is, don’t go – we have to do two more things to see if he’s there.’ He has since changed his story about the Navy SEAL mission in a conversation with a Fox News reporter earlier this year. ‘As commander in chief, if you were ever handed a piece of intelligence that said you could stop an imminent attack on Americans — but you have to use an airstrike to take out a terrorist leader — would you pull the trigger?’ the reporter asked Biden. ‘Well we did – the guy’s name was Osama bin Laden,’ replied Biden, who was vice president when bin Laden was killed. ‘Didn’t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden that day?’ the reporter asked. ‘No, I didn’t,’ Biden said.    Obama later told Mitt Romney that ‘Even some in my own party, including my current vice president, had the same critique as you did’, confirming Biden’s position against the strike on Bin Laden in 2011, reports Fox News. Cops Bust Up an Amish Late-Night Barn Party for Violating Ohio’s Stay-at-Home Order Robert F Kennedy Jr: World’s Unelected ‘President’ Bill Gates Is Using Humans As ‘Guinea Pigs’ 
			 "
Cops Bust Up an Amish Late-Night Barn Party for Violating Ohio’s Stay-at-Home Order,"Northeastern Ohio cops busted up a large, Amish late-night barn party on the weekend after a snitch spotted a large group of buggies and called 911 to report a stay-at-home order violation. The sizable shindig violated Geauga County’s coronavirus social-distancing rules, and according to local police the gregarious group had already been ordered to press pause on church gatherings and parties. But these Amish work hard, they play hard, and they don’t mind doing everything else hard, too. And it seems they had no interest in following the governor’s stay-at-home order.  As relayed by RedState, the bearded, pie-making community’s been so pummeled by the pandemic, Amish Bishops were sent a letter last week by County Health Commissioner Thomas Quade. He implored them: Press pause on church services for the remainder of the month. But you can’t tame a wild stallion. Or a Belgian draft horse. They raise barns and they raise heck, they shingle and they wanna mingle. And no government goon’s gonna suspend their way of life — they’ve got plenty of suspenders already. Sunday night, amid a statewide stay-at-home order, 911 received a ring from a snitch who was singin’ like a canary. It was a rousing report: A cluster of carriages had been spotted outside a large barn. That could only mean one thing — some mustacheless maniacs were partying like it’s 1799. The fuzz wouldn’t stand for it. Geauga Sheriff Scott Hildenbrand explained to Cleveland’s WJWTV: “There is some concern out there and we are getting reports of large gatherings happening. If we get calls, or find out about them, we will go there, break them up and get them out of there. We won’t tolerate this and we have to keep everybody safe.” Just after the pocket watch struck midnight, Geauga County Sherrif’s Office made an arrest and delivered a summons. Sheriff Scott recalled: “When we got there, there was a barn full of people (and) some of them ran.” Those Amish folks are no fools; every Tom, Dick, and Hezekiah knows you skeedaddle when the po-po shows. But: “There was one that was too intoxicated to run, and that person had to be transported by ambulance. “ Two partygoers were charged with underage drinking. It really buggied Commissioner Thomas. I mean, bugged: “It is disappointing. … Those folks are all placing themselves at risk.” Oh, well. Maybe this clampdown is too hard, even for the Amish. After all, it doesn’t take a 9th grade graduate to realize our rights are being taken away. As for the Buckeye State’s Pilgrimish party people, I hope no one else gets cuffed and booked — they’re not fond of being photographed, and mug shots are mandatory. Otherwise, to all you Swiss German makers of fine furniture who risk life and limb in outmoded mills…and to all you bonneted bakers who peddle peach pastries from porches, I salute you. And despite the stay-at-home order, I saith to thee, “Party on.” ‘Grave Injury To 2nd Amendment’: Federal Judge Shoots Down California Law Mandating Background Checks Bin Laden Wanted Biden To Become President Because He Would ‘Plunge US Into Crisis’ 
			 "
‘Grave Injury To 2nd Amendment’: Federal Judge Shoots Down California Law Mandating Background Checks,"A federal judge on Thursday blocked a California law mandating complicated background checks for people buying ammunition, issuing a sharply worded rebuke of “onerous and convoluted” anti-gun regulations that violate the constitutional right to bear arms. U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez in San Diego ruled in favor of the California Rifle & Pistol Association, which had asked him to stop the mandatory checks and related restrictions on ammo sales. “The experiment has been tried. The casualties have been counted. California’s new ammunition background check law misfires and the Second Amendment rights of California citizens have been gravely injured,” Benitez wrote in a 120-page opinion granting the group’s motion for a preliminary injunction. AP report: Voters approved toughening California’s already strict firearms laws in 2016, and the restrictions took effect last July. New York was the first state to require a comprehensive ammunition background check system for each sale, but it never took effect. That left California as the first to the extend firearm background checks to each ammunition sale. Four other states — Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Jersey — require buyers to undergo background checks to obtain firearms or ammunition licenses that they must show when buying bullets, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Hannah Shearer, the center’s litigation director, called the ruling “a dangerous step in the wrong direction” at a time when gun stores are seeing increased sales to those worried about the effect of coronavirus on society or their safety. Tucker Carlson Says Lockdown Is “Largest and Most Expensive Experiment in Human History” Cops Bust Up an Amish Late-Night Barn Party for Violating Ohio’s Stay-at-Home Order 
			 "
Tucker Carlson Says Lockdown Is “Largest and Most Expensive Experiment in Human History”,"Fox News host Tucker Carlson has spoken out against the lockdowns across America aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19.  In a powerful monologue Wednesday night, Carlson questioned the “science” behind the decision to shut down the economy, which has resulted in devastating economic hardship as over 26.3 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits as of last week.  “What country is this?” Carlson asked. “It’s a country in a lockdown. We’re told we have no choice but to do this — to stop our lives completely.” WATCH: “Mass quarantines, they tell us again and again, are the only way to save lives,” Carlson said. “But that’s a lie. They don’t know it’s true, despite what they’ve claimed. There’s no scientific record to consult. It’s never been done. We’re currently living through the largest and most expensive experiment ever conducted in human history. We’ve spent trillions of dollars, and crushed millions of people, purely on the guess that a nationwide lockdown would save us from the coronavirus. Has it worked? Was the guess correct?” Carlson noted that the eight US states which haven’t issued strict lockdown orders are “below the national average of coronavirus cases, and deaths, per capita,” quoting Professor Wilfred Reilly of Kentucky State University, who discovered that “a state’s lockdown strategy had virtually no effect on how severe its outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus was.” “Are you surprised by this?” Carlson asked viewers.  “Maybe you shouldn’t be. You can see the same trend at work in other countries. Sweden, most famously, has never locked down. Restaurants there have never closed. That country is still suffering from coronavirus, suffering more in fact than we are in the U.S. But the country’s epidemic appears to have peaked. And without locking down, Sweden has, and this is the key, has fared far better than other European countries that did lock down. That includes Britain, Italy, Spain and Belgium.” Zerohedge.com reports: Perhaps most damning is new studies which suggest that far more people may have already had coronavirus. “Up to 320,000 adults in Los Angeles apparently had already had it,” said Calrson, citing the world of USC researchers who found that as of early April, upwards of 5.6% of the entire county had possibly contracted the coronavirus.  “At the time, the official number of infected people was about 8,000 people. City officials had no clue. They weren’t even close. The virus had spread throughout a huge population right in the middle of the most restrictive quarantine in American history. What does that tell you? It tells you the lockdown didn’t work.” According to Carlson, officials in lockdown states are “by and large ignoring any evidence that indicts their policies, or that might threaten their new and much-loved power.” “They don’t want to know what the facts are,” he said. “Indeed, some are now promising even longer lockdowns, maybe through the end of the summer, and even tougher punishments for those who flout them.” “This is insanity,” Carlson concluded. “It is definitely not science. This is not science. It has nothing to do with the public’s health, much less the broader public interest. This is instead what happens when mediocre people suddenly find themselves with God-like power: deciding who can go outside, when people can get married, which medical procedures you’re allowed to have. That’s a feeling of omnipotence, and they like that feeling. It fills an empty place inside. They don’t want to give it up. They want it to last forever, even as the country dies. But it can’t last forever. Because it’s not their country. It’s ours.” Carlson then interviewed Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine at Stanford University who authored a report which found that roughly 1.5% of 3,300 volunteers tested for COVID-19 antibodies were positive, and extrapolated (after adjusting for differences between the sample and the population of the  county as a whole) that an between 2.5% and 4% of Santa Clara County residents have antibodies – suggesting that 48,000 – 81,000 people had already been infected in the county by early April. Commenting on the effectiveness of the lockdowns, Ioannidis suggested that we need to wait until the virus waves are “mature,” because “we can have some surprises.” “The science is telling us that this is a common infection. Most people probably don’t recognize that they’re infected, they’re asymptomatic. At the same time it can be a devastating infection, it can kill lots of people” said Ioannidis.

WATCH: ""We had prepared for years""@MelindaGates told @EmmaBarnett how her family had prepared for a pandemic and what they think about wearing masks.Listen live on @BBCSounds 📻 https://t.co/4SnxX44AQs pic.twitter.com/SE9MlxrW44 Transcript of interview:  EMMA BARRETT: In terms of your own — again, just to talk about you and Bill for being so familiar with this — had you made any preparations? I was very struck by when I rewatched Bill’s talk from 2015, he rolled that barrel onto the stage and said, “When I was growing up, nuclear was kind of the threat, everyone was very worried about bombs and all sorts of threats like that, and we had this barrel in our basement where we’d have to go and eat out of it if we went in.” Had you done preparation in your own lives? MELINDA GATES: We had done some preparation, yes. BARRETT: What does the mean in terms of — because we had issues here in the UK with people panic shopping — how does a couple like you, who has this insight, how do you get prepared for that? GATES: A number of years ago, we talked about, “What if there wasn’t clean water? What if there wasn’t enough food? Where might we go? What might we do as a family?” So, I think we should leave those preparations to ourselves. We had prepared, and had some food in the basement in case needed, and now we’re all in the same situation.

Coronavirus May Be Nature’s Response To Climate Change Says Pope Francis,"Pope Francis believes that the coronavirus pandemic is one of “nature’s responses” to humans ignoring the climate crisis.  He has also suggested that people find creative ways of being  at home during lockdown,  saying: “Take care of yourselves for a future that will come” CNN reports: In  an email interview published Wednesday in The Tablet and Commonwealth  magazines, the pontiff said the outbreak offered an opportunity to slow  down the rate of production and consumption and to learn to understand  and contemplate the natural world. “We  did not respond to the partial catastrophes. Who now speaks of the  fires in Australia, or remembers that 18 months ago a boat could cross  the North Pole because the glaciers had all melted? Who speaks now of  the floods?” the Pope said.   “I don’t know if these are the revenge of nature, but they are certainly nature’s responses,” he added. The pandemic has radically changed the way the Vatican operates, with the Pope celebrating Palm Sunday mass in an empty church and the sites normally packed with tourists empty. The  83-year-old Pope, who has a damaged lung from an infection in his 20s,  has twice tested negative for the novel coronavirus.  He is being  distanced from anyone who might be carrying the virus, takes his meals  in his private quarters, and uses hand sanitizer before and after  meeting any guests, the Vatican press office said. Pope  Francis also said in the interview he was recovering from his  bronchitis and praying even more from his residence in the Vatican  during this “time of great uncertainty.”  CNN Reporter Says Coronavirus Lockdown Has ‘Helped Humanity’ Buy Time To Address Global Warming WATCH: Nasty Nancy Wipes Her Dirty Nose With Her Bare Hand, Then Touches House Floor Podium

He claims that the current lockdowns are helping humanity buy time to  address the effects of global warming.  Daily Wire reports: Like many environmentalists, it appears Weir is looking on the bright  side of coronavirus-related lockdowns, which have had an economic impact on an estimated 43% of Americans and left at least 26 million out  of work, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Labor,  issued Thursday. Weir also appears to claim the virus comes as the result of increased deforestation in his Earth Day CNN segment.

coronavirus that causes COVID-19 became a national pandemic, but most 
center on events in Wuhan, China, and focus on either the consumption of
 endangered species, like the pangolin, or the possibility that the 
virus “escaped” from a research lab that was investigating a number of 
coronaviruses without taking proper precaution. The coronavirus has had an impact on pollution, as many outlets noted in their Earth Day coverage Wednesday. Bezos Wealth SKYROCKETS by $24 Billion as 17 Million Americans Lose Their Jobs Coronavirus May Be Nature’s Response To Climate Change Says Pope Francis 
			 "
Bezos Wealth SKYROCKETS by $24 Billion as 17 Million Americans Lose Their Jobs,"One of the world’s richest men, Jeff Bezos, has seen a staggering $24 billion increase in his wealth recently, as ordinary Americans struggle to put food on the table. Just one week after 17 million hard-working Americans filed for unemployment, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos saw his net worth increase to $138.5 billion as Amazon’s stock hit all time highs on Tuesday.  The stock increase was aided by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus flooding the stock market.  With historic unemployment numbers on the horizon, banks are now warning that loan losses fuelled by job cuts could rival those from the 2008 global financial crisis. Among the weakest sectors cutting employees first is the very sector that Amazon is profiting from: retail. Bezos is among the top elites who have seen their fortunes soar as the Fed continues to focus on its sole mandate of jamming stocks higher.  The combined net worth of the world’s 500 richest people is up an eye-watering 20% from its low on March 23, as a result.  Zerohedge.com reports: Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co said: “The wealth gap, it’s only going to get wider with what’s going on now. The really wealthy people haven’t had to worry. Yes, they’re less wealthy, but you haven’t had to worry about putting food on the table or keeping a roof over your head.” Meanwhile, corporate insiders continue to buy their own stock at a quick clip, indicating that executives believe the worst could be behind us. Carnival Corp. board member Randall Weisenburger, for example, bought $10 million of his company’s stock in the open market last week.  While a couple of big names in oil have seen major losses, like Harold Hamm, who has seen his fortune fall 64% to $3.7 billion, other executives are experiencing significant gains. Bezos has added about $24 billion to his wealth in 2020. His ex-wife, Mackenzie Bezos, has seen her net worth climb $8.2 billion to $45.3 billion. Elon Musk has seen his fortune rise by $10.4 billion and the Walton family at the helm of Wal-Mart has seen their combined net worth grow to $169 billion.  Maley concluded: “The unfairness of it all is who is going to benefit from it most. Money makes money.” While Bezos is getting richer, The Verge has reported that Amazon is going to be making “drastic cuts” to affiliate commission rates starting next week: Amazon is planning to make dramatic cuts to commission rates for its affiliate marketing program, which allows media organizations, e-commerce companies, and small and independent businesses to receive a cut of revenue from a sale if a customer lands on the product page and purchases the item through a provided link. The cuts go into effect on April 21st, according to CNBC, and some product categories will see drops of more than 50 percent. The cuts will no doubt come as a blow to digital media companies who spent time building out infrastructure to recommend users buy products from Amazon. The Verge notes that “companies like BuzzFeed and New York Times-owned Wirecutter are among the more prominent commerce providers in the industry” – so we guess we can expect negative op-eds from those blogs at some point soon.  Finally, recall yesterday we reported that Amazon had fired 3 employees who spoke out about working conditions at the company during the coronavirus pandemic. The company confirmed that it had fired Emily Cunningham, Bashir Mohamed and Maren Costa for violating company policy. Amazon commented: “We support every employee’s right to criticize their employer’s working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies. We terminated these employees for repeatedly violating internal policies.” With regard to Mohamed’s firing, the company stated: “This individual was terminated as a result of progressive disciplinary action for inappropriate language, behavior and violating social distancing guidelines.” That, or perhaps Amazon just found their lack of faith in the Jeff Bezos’ best intentions disturbing. London Mayor Sadiq Khan: “Racism” to Blame for Coronavirus Among Minorities CNN Reporter Says Coronavirus Lockdown Has ‘Helped Humanity’ Buy Time To Address Global Warming 
			 "
London Mayor Sadiq Khan: “Racism” to Blame for Coronavirus Among Minorities,"London mayor Sadiq Khan says “structural racism” is to blame for COVID-19 infections among the country’s minority groups.  Khan has urged the British government to start collecting and publishing the ethnicities of those infected with the Chinese virus, claiming that racial inequality is likely the reason why people of black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds have been overrepresented in the pandemic. “Even though it can be uncomfortable for some to acknowledge, we cannot ignore the barriers of discrimination and structural racism that exist in our society, which contribute to ethnic minorities being more likely to suffer from poverty, have underlying health conditions and work in insecure, low-paid jobs,” Mayor Khan wrote in a column for The Guardian. Khan claims that because  “people from ethnic minority backgrounds are overrepresented in poor, overcrowded accommodation, or households with multiple generations under one roof”, they are more likely to become infected with the deadly virus. “Many simply don’t have the luxury of being able to work safely from home during the lockdown. All of this contributes to a BAME population with worse health than average, lower life expectancy and a greater prevalence of serious underlying health conditions, such as heart disease, asthma and diabetes,” he said. Breitbart.com reports: The London mayor also called for a “new social contract” after the coronavirus pandemic has passed, in order to reduce “racial and economic equality, and prioritises the welfare and wellbeing of every single community in this country”. Khan’s attempt to link coronavirus cases with alleged structural racism echoes similar left narratives in the United States. Progressive members of the U.S. Congress including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Rep. Robin Kelly (D-IL) made a similar demand of the government to release data about the racial background of coronavirus patients. “Any attempt to contain COVID-19 in the United States will have to address its potential spread in low-income communities of color, first and foremost to protect the lives of people in those communities, but also to slow the spread of the virus in the country as a whole,” the lawmakers wrote. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, the far-left congresswoman from New York, suggested that coronavirus relief money should be “drafted with a lens of reparations” in order to make up for “environmental racism” and other “underlying health conditions” that have caused minorities to be “disproportionately” affected by the virus. To date, the coronavirus is known to hav infected some nearly two and a half million people of widely disparate racial backgrounds across the globe. USA on Brink of “Mass Civil Unrest” – Expert Warns Bezos Wealth SKYROCKETS by $24 Billion as 17 Million Americans Lose Their Jobs 
			 "
USA on Brink of “Mass Civil Unrest” – Expert Warns,"America is on the brink of “mass civil unrest” as a result of the draconian lockdown measures imposed by local and federal government, an expert has warned. Demonstrations against coronavirus stay-at-home orders have exploded across the country over the las week after President Trump appeared to encourage them on social media. The National Guard has been deployed in some areas to deal with potential disorder.  Speaking to Sky News Australia, James Brown, a former Australian Army officer who commanded a cavalry troop in Iraq, warned that the very specific mentality of Americans made them much more likely to resist lockdown measures compared to citizens of other countries.  “There is that part of the US political psyche that takes rights to a complete extreme,” said Brown, adding that “mass civil unrest” is a possibility due to Americans sharing a “deep independent streak that believes the government is a nice-to-have not a must-have.” WATCH: Summit.news reports: The host of the show opined that if “anarchy” were to break out across the United States, “the government can’t bring the people to heel” due to the Second Amendment. Brown said he had friends on Capitol Hill who were very worried about mass social disorder and a “gun battle on the streets.” Brown said that so long as most people believed that states were making progress on battling coronavirus, they would accept and adhere to lockdown laws for the time being. “But people will chafe, that idea of individual freedom and liberty is much stronger in the U.S. than it is Australia,” he added.

			 "
Rosie O’Donnell: Americans Are Gonna Vote ‘Mentally Ill’ Trump Out In a ‘Landslide’,"Far-left actress and activist Rosie O’Donnell has predicted that Americans will “rise to the occasion” in November’s presidential election and vote “mentally ill” Donald Trump out of office in a landslide. “I think November we’re gonna be a landslide and take him out, that’s what I have to believe,” O’Donnell said when asked about this year’s election during an appearance on Marc Maron’s podcast that aired on Monday.  “I firmly believe that the heart of the nation is bigger than his mental illness and people will rise to the occasion and vote him out.” Rosie O’Donnell has a history of making wild claims about President Trump. Last year she claimed the president has an incestuous relationship with his daughter Ivanka.  “There’s a prevalent incest feel amongst Donald Trump and his children, at least his daughter. Very creepy…I think she’s, you know, a talentless, non-intelligent, non-powerful woman,” said O’Donnell.  Last year, the Sleepless in Seattle star predicted that Trump would be “arrested” before the 2020 presidential election even takes place. “I think he’ll be arrested,” O’Donnell said at the time. “I believe in America and I believe in our political system and I believe we will right the wrong of the tyranny of Donald Trump.” With a little over six months to go until November’s election and the dropping of all charges of Russian collusion against the president, it seems unlikely that her first prediction will bear out.  With the Democrats seemingly intent on nominating former Vice President Joe Biden for the presidency, it also seems highly unlikely President Trump is going to lose in a landslide.  410,000 People Sign White House Petition To Investigate Bill Gates For Crimes Against Humanity USA on Brink of “Mass Civil Unrest” – Expert Warns 
			 "
"410,000 People Sign White House Petition To Investigate Bill Gates For Crimes Against Humanity","A petition to investigate Bill Gates for “crimes against humanity” and “medical malpractice” has amassed a staggering 410,000 signatures from concerned citizens, more than four times the number required for an official response from the White House. The “We the People” petition asks the federal government to call on Congress to investigate the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, stating that “Congress and all other governing bodies are derelict in duty until a thorough and public inquiry is complete.“ The White House petition can be accessed here. The petition created on April 10 reached the threshold of 100,000 signatures within days, meaning the White House should address the issue within 60 days. As the White House “We the People” website explains, the petition platform empowers every American citizen “to become an agent of change” – and, if a petition gains 100,000 signatures in 30 days, the White House will “make sure it gets in front of the appropriate policy experts”: “We the People is a platform that empowers the American public to take this action like never before – it’s a way for anybody, anywhere, to speak directly to the government and become an agent for change. “With We the People, you can easily create a petition online, share it, and collect signatures. If you gather 100,000 signature in 30 days, we’ll review your petition, make sure it gets in front of the appropriate policy experts, and issue an official response.” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, has also sharply criticized Gates for what he describes as a “messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology.” “Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vac ID enterprise) and give him dictatorial control over global health policy—the spear tip of corporate neo-imperialism,” Kennedy Jr. wrote. “Gates’ obsession with vaccines seems fueled by a messianic conviction that he is ordained to save the world with technology and a god-like willingness to experiment with the lives of lesser humans.” RELATED: Robert F.

			 "
FCC Investigating Schiff for ‘Privacy Law’ Violations During Impeachment Sham,"FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr is seeking answers from House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff about his use of secret subpoenas that essentially set up a “unilateral & unchecked” surveillance state to target the president’s allies. Rep. Adam Schiff spent months launching secret impeachment hearings and obliterating ethical boundaries, gambling on the assumption that his conduct would not be called into question. But Schiff gambled and lost. Brendan Carr, one of the straightest arrows in government, sent Schiff a five-page letter last month demanding answers about his unusual subpoena activity. “Chairman Schiff has been collecting Americans’ private call records through a secret & partisan process. He even published some of them in the Impeachment Report,” Carr tweeted along with a copy of his letter. “These sensitive records are protected by federal law. His conduct raises serious concerns & I’ve asked for answers. By proceeding in secret, Schiff deprived Americans — from private citizens to his political opponents to a journalist — of their legal right to go to court and seek to maintain the confidentiality of their sensitive call records.  “As a country, are we comfortable with one political party in Congress having the unilateral & unchecked power to secretly obtain & publicize the confidential call records of any private citizen, journalist, or government official? Chairman Schiff has been doing exactly that.” Chairman Schiff has been collecting Americans’ private call records through a secret & partisan process.He even published some of them in the Impeachment Report.These sensitive records are protected by federal law.His conduct raises serious concerns & I’ve asked for answers https://t.co/WrdGf1n1P2 Newsmax reports: Schiff published Nunes’ phone records in the committee’s sweeping impeachment report, indicating that Nunes had multiple communications with key figures in the inquiry: Giuliani, and Giuliani’s Soviet-born associate Lev Parnas, who has been indicted on campaign finance charges. The records also show Giuliani was in communication with Solomon, a conservative opinion columnist. Kim Strassel of The Wall Street Journal described Schiff’s actions as devious and abusive. Schiff “didn’t notify his targets, and Republican committee members were barred from telling the public what they knew,” Strassel wrote. “Worse, he deceived one of his targets. He sent a subpoena for call records to Mr. Giuliani on Sept. 30 and suggested Mr. Giuliani had two weeks to work with the committee, even as Mr. Schiff was already secretly demanding Giuliani call records from a phone carrier.” Schiff has said it is standard procedure for investigators to seek phone records; he hasn’t revealed the names of individuals found in the call log who are not the target of a criminal investigation. “It is, I think, deeply concerning that at a time when the president of the United States was using the power of his office to dig up dirt on a political rival that there may be evidence that there were members of Congress that were complicit in that activity,” Schiff said on Dec. 3.

Democrat Rep Resigns and Endorses Trump For Reelection: ‘I’m Putting My Country Before My Party’,"Georgia House Democrat Rep. Vernon Jones has endorsed President Donald Trump for reelection and resigned from his seat, stating “I’m sick and tired of me and my family being attacked and harassed by the Democrat Party for putting my country before my party.“ Jones caused shockwaves when he made the announcement in a formal statement on Wednesday morning, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. “Turn the lights off, I have left the plantation,” Jones said in the statement. “Someone else can occupy that suite. Therefore, I intend not to complete my term effective April 22, 2020.” Reporter Hayley Mason also posted a full statement from Jones on Twitter. “I’m sick and tired of me and my family being attacked and harassed by the Democrat Party for putting my country before my party. I take pride in being an independent thinker,” the Georgia Democrat said. “I don’t plan to leave the Democratic Party because somebody’s got to be in there to hold them accountable —hold them accountable to how they are treating black people (and) root out the bigotry,” Jones said on The Rashad Richey Morning Show shortly after announcing his resignation. On Twitter, Jones wrote: “The Left hates me because they can’t control me. They can stay mad.” The Left hates me because they can’t control me. They can stay mad. Newsweek report: Jones drew substantial criticism after he endorsed Trump for re-election last Tuesday. The Georgia state lawmaker pointed to the president’s criminal justice reform efforts, as well as low levels of unemployment for black Americans during most of Trump’s presidency. “It’s very simple to me. President Trump’s handling of the economy, his support for historically black colleges and his criminal justice initiatives drew me to endorse his campaign,” Jones told the AJC last week. “There are a lot of African Americans who clearly see and appreciate he’s doing something that’s never been done before,” he added. “When you look at the unemployment rates among black Americans before the pandemic, they were at historic lows. That’s just a fact.” Jones had shared a video explaining his endorsement of Trump on Twitter as well. “I’m a Georgia State Representative and lifelong Democrat. But in this election, I’ll be casting my vote for @realdonaldtrump. I didn’t leave the Democratic Party. The Party left me,” he captioned the post with the clip. Nikema Williams, the chair of Georgia’s Democratic Party, said Jones “does not stand for our values” last week.  D.C. Police Confirm ‘Active, Ongoing Investigation’ Into Joe Biden Sex Assault Complaint FCC Investigating Schiff for ‘Privacy Law’ Violations During Impeachment Sham 
			 "
"D.C. Police Confirm ‘Active, Ongoing Investigation’ Into Joe Biden Sex Assault Complaint","The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia has confirmed an “active, ongoing investigation” into the sex assault complaint against Democrat presidential nominee Joe Biden, while complainant Tara Reade says police have assigned her a “victim’s advocate” who is helping her with “safety planning.”  “This is an active, ongoing investigation, and there are no further details to provide at this time,” a Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson told the Washington Examiner Tuesday regarding Reade’s case.  Tara Reade, the former Biden Senate staffer who accused him of sexual assault, said the D.C. police department has assigned her a victim’s advocate  who is “helping me mainly with safety planning.”  “Cases that are handled by the Metropolitan Police Department’s Sexual Assault Unit go through a multi-review prior to being assigned a disposition. This case is progressing through the review process,” the Metropolitan Police Department spokesperson said. The investigation remaining open, despite the alleged incident occurring past the statute of limitations, struck multiple experts as highly unusual.  WashingtonExaminer reports: Reade alleges that in 1993 when she worked as a staff assistant in Biden’s Senate office, he pushed her up against the wall and penetrated her with his fingers. Biden’s presidential campaign denies Reade’s allegations, although the former two-term vice president has yet to comment on the matter directly. On April 9, Reade filed an incident report with the D.C. police that said she “disclosed that she was the victim of a sexual assault which was committed by Subject-2 in 1993.” Reade has confirmed that Subject-2 is Joe Biden, 77, who was a Delaware senator from 1973-2009 before becoming President Barack Obama’s vice president.  Reade, 56, said that she filed an incident report for “safety reasons,” for the purpose of establishing a paper trail in case “something happened to me” and to show that she is serious about her allegation since it is illegal to make a false police report.  Since coming forward with her allegations against Biden, she regularly receives threatening and vulgar messages, she told the Washington Examiner. Because the incident is past the statute of limitations, she told the Washington Examiner that she expected the police to do no more than note her complaint and not investigate it. Reade told the Washington Examiner that she has no plans to sue Biden in civil court, where D.C. has removed the statute of limitations on sex crimes. Reade said that she was assigned a victim’s advocate within the police department and connected to another one through an outside nonprofit group. “They’re helping me mainly with safety planning,” she said. The D.C. police did not confirm that Reade was assigned a victim’s advocate, although experts say such aid is standard for any individual who claims they were assaulted.  Former police officers who have worked in D.C., and sex crime experts, say there could be numerous reasons why the case has yet to be closed.  “Sometimes they receive information that is never going to lead to a criminal charge, but nonetheless, does invoke some of their obligations as public safety officials,” said Wendy Murphy, a professor of sexual violence law at New England Law Boston and a former sex crimes prosecutor.  “Is it usual or typical? I think the answer is no. But this is also not a usual, typical case,” Murphy said.  Among the reasons that the case remains open nearly two weeks after Reade made her report, Murphy said, could be that the officers have concerns about safety, or they could think that what Reade reported leads to other revelations.  “You don’t waste resources reviewing something that has no purpose,” Murphy said.  The decision by the D.C. police department struck several former police officers as peculiar, citing the fact that there is ultimately little law enforcement can do should they believe Reade’s allegations.  One former officer, who spent years on the force in Washington and spoke to the Washington Examiner on the condition of anonymity because he now works as a consultant for various police departments around the country, said the move struck him as out-of-the-ordinary.  “I wouldn’t expect a department to look into this for that long, maybe just take a report and close it out. It would also automatically be closed. They wouldn’t spend time investigating something they can’t prosecute,” the individual said.  “I’m sure the D.C. PD has plenty of work without creating it. Obviously, it’s a very high-profile case, so high-profile cases get a lot more attention, unfortunately, than if the victim or offender wasn’t a known public figure. In spite of that, I wouldn’t expect them to proceed on something that had no chance of getting prosecution.”  Robert Pusins, a former police officer in Florida who now serves as an expert witness in civil trials, said that he thinks the case is open because “it involves a high-profile person such as a former vice president.”  “It’s a balancing act, and either way, the police are gonna be caught in the middle and criticized for not investigating thoroughly or investigating thoroughly a 30-year-old claim,” Pusins said.  Reade told the Washington Examiner that she hopes this development encourages any other people who might have an allegation against Biden.  “There is a mechanism for them to remain anonymous by going to the D.C. metro police, or they can direct them to their law enforcement,” she said. While Everyone Talks About Covid-19, Democrats Attempt to Sneak In Strictest Gun Control Measures Ever Democrat Rep Resigns and Endorses Trump For Reelection: ‘I’m Putting My Country Before My Party’ 
			 "
"While Everyone Talks About Covid-19, Democrats Attempt to Sneak In Strictest Gun Control Measures Ever","With the whole country distracted by news of the coronavirus and lockdown, lawmakers in Washington D.C. are attempting to sneak in one of the most draconian anti-gun bills that the country has ever seen. Titled the “Gun Violence Prevention and Community Safety Act of 2020,” the bill will require all Americans to obtain a license before purchasing a firearm. The change of law would mean our constitutional right to keep and bear arms would instead become a privilege for which we must first obtain permission for from the federal government. The bill, introduced on January 30, requires that a person must be 21 years or older to buy a gun, as well as pass a written and field test to “demonstrate safe use of a firearm.” The lawmakers tout that their bill would “require individuals to obtain a license,” “raise the minimum age from 18 to 21 years,” “establish new background check requirements,” and “create a statutory process for a family or household member to petition a court for an extreme risk protection order to remove firearms from an individual,” among other things. Phillip Schneider at Waking Times reports: The purchaser must also hand over a photograph, giving the government valuable facial recognition data. Additionally, the license only lasts for 10 years and gun buyers could have their purchase delayed by up to 40 days before the Attorney General issues it to them. The law would also make it illegal for a parent to pass down a gun to their children without going through time-consuming and costly legal hoops first, at threat of fines or jail time. In other words, the bill includes everything that the most radical anti-gunners want, short of an outright ban and repeal of the second amendment. It includes new age limits, red flag confiscations, increased taxes on guns and ammunition, an arbitrary ban on nearly all semi-automatic rifles, and the requirement of a federal firearms license. While also being what the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) calls, “the worst anti-gun legislation that FPC have ever seen,” the bill is illegal both in the letter and spirit of the second amendment. “On every question of construction let us carry ourselves back to the time when the Constitution was adopted,” said Thomas Jefferson on interpreting the constitution. “Recollect the spirit manifested in the debates, and instead of trying what meaning can be squeezed out of the text, or invented against it, conform to the probable one which was passed.” It’s hard to imagine that the founding fathers, after fighting a brutal war for independence and passing the bill of rights specifically to protect the people against government overreach, intended for “shall not be infringed” to mean “it’s okay if the federal government requires me to get a license, provide them with pictures, and pass their safety tests before I can exercise my right to keep and bear arms.” Nonetheless, that won’t stop this coalition of 18 congressional Democrats from attempting to force their unconstitutional law on the American people. If this bill were to pass, it would place the most draconian federal restrictions on access to firearms in the history of the country.

Missouri SUES ‘Lying’ China For Coronavirus: ‘Campaign of Deceit Launched This Pandemic’,"The state of Missouri has filed a lawsuit against the Chinese communist government over the coronavirus pandemic, claiming China is responsible for the outbreak that has caused “enormous death, suffering, and economic losses they inflicted on the world, including Missourians.” The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for Eastern Missouri on Tuesday, alleges Chinese officials silenced whistleblowers and lied to the world about the nature of the coronavirus. ‘The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease,’ Republican Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office said in a written statement. ‘They must be held accountable for their actions.’ ‘An appalling campaign of deceit, concealment, misfeasance, and inaction by Chinese authorities unleashed this pandemic,‘ the suit says. DailyMail report: This marks the first time a state has sued China over its handling of the COVID-19 outbreak.  World leaders including President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, Australia’s Foreign Minister Marise Payne have expressed concerns over Beijing’s transparency amid the virus. On Monday 22 Republican lawmakers requested that the Trump administration bring a case against China to the International Court of Justice for the country’s actions in the coronavirus pandemic.  Schmitt’s office accuses China of negligence and claims the pandemic cost Missourians possibly tens of billions of dollars in economic damage.   Schmitt’s office is seeking unspecified damages for deaths in Missouri and the hit the virus has taken on the state’s economy. ‘In Missouri, the impact of the virus is very real – thousands have been infected and many have died, families have been separated from dying loved ones, small businesses are shuttering their doors, and those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to put food on their table,’ he said in his statement.  In Missouri there are over 6,000 cases and over 200 deaths in the the state. Nationwide there are over 800,000 cases of the virus and over 45,000 deaths.  One estimate says that coronavirus lockdowns in the state have cost Missouri $44billion, according to Fox.  The state also accuses China of hiding key information that could have prevented the spread of the virus and hoarding masks and other personal protective equipment as the rest of the globe was in dire need.  ‘An appalling campaign of deceit, concealment, misfeasance, and inaction by Chinese authorities unleashed this pandemic,‘ the suit says. ‘During the critical weeks of the initial outbreak, Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistleblowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded personal protective equipment—thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable.’  While the suit lists a number of claims of China’s wrongdoing, it also mentions the theory that the virus could have escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a biosafety level 4 lab that studies infectious diseases including coronavirus.  The lawsuit names The People’s Republic of China – which is the official Chinese government – and the Chinese Communist Party.  China is already facing similar lawsuits filed by at least seven federal class-action suits filed by private groups in US courts.   However, international law experts say that efforts to hold China liable for the coronavirus in U.S. courts will likely fail. A legal doctrine called sovereign immunity offers foreign governments broad protection from being sued in U.S. courts, said Tom Ginsburg, a professor of international law at the University of Chicago, said to Reuters.  He says the recent flurry of lawsuits against China serve a political end for Republican leaders facing an election in November. ‘We are seeing a lot of people on the political right focus on the China issue to cover up for the U.S. government’s own errors,’ Ginsburg said. ‘If the United States wants to bring claims against China, it will have to do so in an international forum. There is no civil jurisdiction over such claims in U.S. courts,’ Chimène Keitner, an international law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, said.   Netherlands Begins Euthanizing Patients With Severe Dementia While Everyone Talks About Covid-19, Democrats Attempt to Sneak In Strictest Gun Control Measures Ever 
			 "
Netherlands Begins Euthanizing Patients With Severe Dementia,"Doctors can now euthanize patients with severe dementia in the Netherlands without fear of prosecution even if the patient no longer expresses a wish to die, following a ruling by the country’s supreme court. The decision followed a landmark case in which a doctor was acquitted of wrongdoing for euthanizing a 74-year-old woman with severe Alzheimer’s who had requested the procedure before her condition became worse. The unnamed woman had to be restrained by her family, despite being given a sedative in her coffee before the procedure.  The Guardian report: Prosecutors accused the doctor of going through with the euthanasia without properly consulting her client, saying the 74-year-old woman might have changed her mind about dying. Lower Dutch courts acquitted the doctor of wrongdoing and prosecutors dropped the charges. The case was referred to the supreme court for a legal clarification “in the interest of the law”. The Hague-based court ruled: “A physician may carry out a written request beforehand for euthanasia in people with advanced dementia.” But it would have to be under the strict rules for euthanasia, including that the patient must have “unbearable and endless suffering” and that at least two doctors must have agreed to carry out the procedure. The patient must also have requested euthanasia before they could “no longer express their will as a result of advanced dementia”. Tuesday’s verdict underscored similar judgments in the lower courts, which also agreed that the 64-year-old doctor followed the correct procedures prescribed by the government. The case was seen as an important test of the law in the Netherlands, which legalised euthanasia in 2002, followed shortly afterwards by neighbouring Belgium. Marina Abramovic Demands ‘Conspiracy Theorists’ Leave Her Alone: ‘I’m Not a Satanist’ Missouri SUES ‘Lying’ China For Coronavirus: ‘Campaign of Deceit Launched This Pandemic’

Marina Abramovic Demands ‘Conspiracy Theorists’ Leave Her Alone: ‘I’m Not a Satanist’,"Marina Abramovic, who enjoys posing with flayed goat heads and brewing blood, feces, semen and breast milk cocktails for political elites, is demanding “conspiracy theorists” leave her alone and stop accusing her of Satanism. In an interview with the New York Times on Tuesday, the “Spirit Cooker” insisted “I am an artist, not a Satanist.” “I need to open my heart,” Abramovic said. “I really want to ask these people, ‘Can you stop with this? Can you stop harassing me? Can’t you see that this is just the art I’ve been doing for 50 years of my life?’” According to Abramovic, posing with flayed goat heads in blood-red vinyl outfits does not mean she is a Satanist — it’s art. Brewing blood, feces, semen and breast milk cocktails for political elites and hosting dinner parties where celebrity guests “pretend” to consume human flesh has nothing at all to do with Satanism — it’s just art, OK?  That totally explains why Allison Mack, the Hollywood actress and convicted child trafficker and NXIVM occultist, posted a picture of Abramovic on her social media just before fleeing to Mexico in 2018 prior to her arrest — she’s just a prolific “artist.” H8VRVViW.jpg (512×512) https://t.co/Si1wYHhRAL pic.twitter.com/cFKHBB3BPh On Good Friday, the holiest day in the Christian calendar, Bill Gates’ Microsoft released a commercial promoting its association with the elite’s favorite artist: Marina Abramovic.  After a huge backlash from internet users calling her out as a Satanist, the video was set to “private” and all traces of the doomed campaign were scrubbed from Microsoft’s official website. Take a look at some of Marina Abramovic’s “art” and decide for yourself. A friendly word of advice for Abramovic: if you aren’t prepared to receive criticism for appearances in widely-viewed advertisements for major international corporations like Microsoft, maybe you shouldn’t do them. God bless! Barr Threatens Legal Action Against Fascist Governors Imposing Unconstitutional Lockdowns Netherlands Begins Euthanizing Patients With Severe Dementia 
			 "
Barr Threatens Legal Action Against Fascist Governors Imposing Unconstitutional Lockdowns,"Attorney General William Barr is considering taking legal action against governors who continue to impose draconian, unconstitutional rules for dealing with the coronavirus.  Harsh restrictions such as stay-at-home orders and shutting down businesses are justified up to a point, Barr said in an interview Tuesday on “The Hugh Hewitt Show.” Eventually, though, states should move to fairer more targeted measures, Barr said.  “We have to give businesses more freedom to operate in a way that’s reasonably safe,” Barr said. “To the extent that governors don’t and impinge on either civil rights or on the national commerce — our common market that we have here — then we’ll have to address that.” Yahoo News reports: Barr’s comments come as the Trump administration and states are struggling — and at times fighting with each other — over the best strategy to deal with the crisis. Trump has stoked tensions with some Democratic governors who are dealing with protests against stringent social-distancing rules, even as his administration backs guidelines that call for states to open up gradually. One way the Justice Department might act against state or local officials is by joining lawsuits brought by citizens or businesses over restrictions, Barr said. He acknowledged that state governments are at “a sensitive stage,” as they try to balance health and safety against pressure to reopen. But he said that “as lawsuits develop, as specific cases emerge in the states, we’ll take a look at them.” “We’re looking carefully at a number of these rules that are being put into place,” Barr said. “And if we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them. And if they’re not and people bring lawsuits, we file statement of interest and side with the plaintiffs.” In a sign of the president’s contradictory messages on the issue, Trump tweeted last Friday that his supporters should “liberate” Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia — three states with Democratic governors and strict stay-at-home orders. The move came just a day after Trump outlined the return-to-work guidelines that are contingent on states meeting specific benchmarks on testing and a decline in Covid-19 cases. ‘Off the Rails’ Washington Governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat, responded angrily to Trump’s tweets, accusing him of “fomenting rebellion” and “spewing dangerous, anti-democratic rhetoric.” “The White House released a sensible plan,” Inslee said in a statement, and “less than 24 hours later the president is off the rails.” Trump will meet with one Democratic governor, New York’s Andrew Cuomo, at the White House on Tuesday. Cuomo said he’ll use his 4 p.m. session in the Oval Office to lobby for more supplies needed to process coronavirus tests. Trump last week said states have the primary responsibility to expand virus testing. The latest developments signal that as Trump’s public support over his handling of the virus crisis weakens, he and his top aides are increasingly looking at ways to move on. Pressuring Barr Conservative groups and activists have been ramping up pressure for the Trump administration — and Barr in particular — to act against governors taking a hard line. Alleging “rampant abuses of constitutional rights and civil liberties,” a group led by former Attorney General Ed Meese wrote Barr this week urging him “to undertake immediate review of all the orders that have been issued by the states and local governments across the nation.” In Tuesday’s radio interview, Barr said “these are very, very burdensome impingements on liberty. And we adopted them, we have to remember, for the limited purpose of slowing down the spread, that is bending the curve. We didn’t adopt them as the comprehensive way of dealing with this disease.” “You can’t just keep on feeding the patient chemotherapy and say well, we’re killing the cancer, because we were getting to the point where we’re killing the patient,” Barr said. “And now is the time that we have to start looking ahead and adjusting to more targeted therapies.” Abrams Pushes Mail-In Voting: “Voter Fraud Is a MYTH” Marina Abramovic Demands ‘Conspiracy Theorists’ Leave Her Alone: ‘I’m Not a Satanist’ 
			 "
Abrams Pushes Mail-In Voting: “Voter Fraud Is a MYTH”,"Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams has dismissed concerns about possible fraud in voting by mail, saying that voter fraud was “by and large, a myth.” Appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” Abrams claimed President Trump’s concern about voter fraud was unfounded.  Abrams said, “The reality is, if we go ahead and get mail-in ballots to as many voters as possible, you shorten the lines which means you can move as many people out of needing to be in person which lets you focus on those who must show up to vote in person – the disabled, those who have language barriers, the homeless and those who have been displaced by COVID-19 and do not have mailing addresses that are stable, or those whose absentee ballots don’t reach them. But we have to follow a gold standard, which means that we do what is necessary to protect those ballots. But here’s the thing. Voter fraud is, by and large, a myth. The President of the United States, number one, voted by mail just recently, and so it worked for him. The concern he has is that it will actually work for every American. Our elections are not partisan. The choices we make are, but the elections themselves should be available to every eligible American citizen. And that is why we are all working so hard to ensure that we can not only flatten the curve but ensure our democracy. What we saw happen in Wisconsin was a travesty and a tragedy, and it does not have to happen.” Washingtonexaminer.com reports: Both Abrams and her campaign manager have blamed “voter suppression” for her 2018 loss in Georgia’s gubernatorial race to businessman Brian Kemp.  It was reported this month that over 28 million mail-in ballots have been lost over the last decade, and a court briefing in New Mexico showed that thousands of ineligible voters in the state are eligible to receive mail-in ballots, including many dead people.  Last year, the Heritage Foundation compiled a list of over 1,000 documented cases of voter fraud, yielding 938 criminal convictions across 47 states. Democrat voices across the country, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former first lady Michelle Obama, have called for an increase in mail-in voting to slow the spread of the coronavirus. “Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to statewide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it,” Trump said earlier this month. “Tremendous potential for voter fraud, and for whatever reason, doesn’t work out well for Republicans.” De Blasio ‘Surprised’ to Learn Prisoners He Set Free Have Gone on Crime Spree Barr Threatens Legal Action Against Fascist Governors Imposing Unconstitutional Lockdowns 
			 "
De Blasio ‘Surprised’ to Learn Prisoners He Set Free Have Gone on Crime Spree,"New York’s Democrat mayor, Bill de Blasio, says he is surprised to learn that many of the prisoners he recently set free over coronavirus fears have gone on a crime spree.  After learning that inmates released from NYC’s notorious Rikers Island were committing new crimes, de Blasio complained that the criminals’ actions were “unconscionable.”  “I think it’s unconscionable just on a human level that folks were shown mercy and this is what some of them have done,” de Blasio said during his morning briefing. Dailywire.com reports: De Blasio protested that few released criminals had committed new crimes, saying, “We do see some recidivism. I have not seen a huge amount, but any amount is obviously troubling. We’re going to just keep buckling down on it, making sure there’s close monitoring and supervision to the maximum step possible. And the NYPD is going to keep doing what they’re doing.” The Daily Wire reported, “At least 50 of 1,500 inmates released from lockup over concerns that the virus could spread quickly within a jail have been rearrested, according to the New York Post. Some of the inmates recaptured have been released again under the city’s program to decrease jail populations during the pandemic.” The New York Times reported on March 30, “In New York City, where the jail system’s chief physician warned several days ago that ‘a storm is coming,’ Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had released at least 650 people by Sunday from Rikers Island, the city’s main jail complex. Most of those inmates were convicted of nonviolent crimes and serving sentences of less than a year. Hundreds more were under review for possible release.” In May 2019, de Blasio stated he wanted to “more than triple” the number of teens released from jails with no bail, even if they had been charged with armed robbery, assault or burglary. Last September the de Blasio administration announced that the City Planning Commission had approved closing the prison at Rikers Island. He stated, “With today’s vote, we are one step closer to closing Rikers Island and creating a smaller, safer, fairer jail system.  That’s one step closer to bringing people back to their communities and families, one step closer to ending the cycle of recidivism and one step closer to ending mass incarceration once and for all.” As far as the groundhog … In 2014, de Blasio’s press secretary, Phil Walzak, protested vehemently to the media that de Blasio had not cold-bloodedly murdered the famed Staten Island weather-predicting groundhog. The brouhaha started after The New York Post reported in September 2014 that the Staten Island Zoo’s groundhog, “Chuck,” had died because de Blasio had dropped the groundhog on its head on February 2 at the Groundhog Day ceremony. The groundhog was found dead in its enclosure at the Staten Island Zoo on February 9. The Post reported: Instead of revealing the sad loss, the zoo — which gets nearly half of its $3.5 million in annual funding from the city — told the staff to keep the mayor’s office in the dark about the animal’s fate. They told only a few zoo supporters — but claimed that the groundhog had died of natural causes. “I was told he died of old age, that he went to that big farm in the sky,” said Assemblyman Matthew Titone (D-SI), who later learned how the animal had died. At the end of September 2014, de Blasio wouldn’t admit he was responsible for the animal’s death, saying, “I’ll refer that to the Staten Island Zoo.” Sensing the condemnation of his boss that might eventuate from the death of the groundhog, Walzak wrote New York Times editorial-board member Lawrence Downes. “Oh, please how can a reasonable, rational viewer watch that and ignore the squirming and writhing of the animal as it is placed into the mayor’s hands?” He wrote another member of the media, “The only thing I care abt is people saying mayor killed groundhog . . . which is not true!” Coronavirus Vaccine About To Be Trialled On People In UK Abrams Pushes Mail-In Voting: “Voter Fraud Is a MYTH”

Coronavirus Vaccine About To Be Trialled On People In UK,"A UK vaccine for the coronavirus is to be tested on human ‘guinea pigs’ from Thursday.    British health secretary  Matt Hancock has promised to give medical teams everything they need but also warned that “nothing about this process is certain”.        Up to 510 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55 across multiple locations in the U.K. are set to take part in the clinical trial. Scientists have already started large-scale production of the vaccine and say they hope to have one million doses ready for use by September.  Sky News reports: The COVID-19 vaccine is being developed by scientists at the University of Oxford, who have said it has an 80% chance of success. Mr Hancock told the government’s daily briefing that the Oxford trial and another at Imperial College London would each get at least another £20m of public money. The
 Jenner Institute team at Oxford is starting production before the trial
 is complete and wants about a million doses ready to be sent out by 
September. Mr Hancock said developing a vaccine is an “uncertain 
science” but that the two teams were making “rapid progress” and would 
be backed “to the hilt”. He said: “At the same time we’ll invest in manufacturing capability 
so if either of these vaccines safely works then we can make it 
available for the British people as soon as humanely possible.”  WHO, Gates Foundation & Wuhan’s Virology Lab Hacked, Data Leaked De Blasio ‘Surprised’ to Learn Prisoners He Set Free Have Gone on Crime Spree

Shortly after news of the hack 
went public, conspiracy theorists didn’t waste any time in sharing the 
data aggressively across various platforms, push the idea that COVID-19 
was engineered in a Wuhan lab. “Using the data, far-right 
extremists were calling for a harassment campaign while sharing

Cotton: W.H.O.’s Tedros Received Payments From China,"Sen. Tom Cotton says World Health Organization boss Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and others were paid by the Chinese government and called for W.H.O. members to be open to lawsuits in the United States. On Tuesday’s “Hugh Hewitt Show,” Cotton responded to the World Health Organization’s claim that the coronavirus originated in animals and wasn’t manipulated in a lab.  “The most plausible explanation is that, through incompetent, slipshod safety practices, one of those viruses escaped from the lab and began to infect people in Wuhan. So the W.H.O. is answering a question that is not being asked, which tells you they’re trying to spin and cover up for China once again. The W.H.O. is a corrupt, rotten organization,” Cotton said. Host Hewitt asked Cotton if he thinks “Tedros and others have received direct financial payments from the PRC and the CCP?” Cotton responded, “I do, Hugh. Going back to Dr. Tedros’ time in Ethiopia, where China had one of its first Belt and Road initiatives, corruption, payoffs, bribes, and kickbacks follow fast on the heels of the Belt and Road initiative. And China aggressively campaigned in 2017 for Dr. Tedros to become the head of the W.H.O. You have to ask yourself, why would they do that? And looking at the W.H.O.’s performance, especially over the last three months, related to this pandemic, you have to ask yourself, why have they covered up and defended China at every single turn?” Cotton added that members of the W.H.O. should be open to lawsuits in the U.S., “And if they’re not, then we’ll look at legislation that would address that.” Joe Biden: I’d Pick Michelle Obama as VP ‘in a Heartbeat’ WHO, Gates Foundation & Wuhan’s Virology Lab Hacked, Data Leaked

Bill Clinton Prevented CIA From Killing Bin Laden a Few Years Before 9/11 Cotton: W.H.O.’s Tedros Received Payments From China 
			 "
Bill Clinton Prevented CIA From Killing Bin Laden a Few Years Before 9/11,"When the U.S. military had a chance at killing Obama bin Laden in the 1990s, after pinpointing his location in Pakistan, they were stopped from doing so because of an order signed by President Bill Clinton. According to a new documentary, the order in effect at the time allowed the CIA to engage in “lethal activity” against the AL Qaeda leader, but the purpose of the strike could not be to kill him. “We were being asked to remove this threat to the United States essentially with one hand tied behind our backs,” said now-former CIA station chief Bob Grenier in Showtime’s “The Longest War,” in a clip posted by The Daily Beast.  At the time, Grenier was based in Islamabad, Pakistan. Bin Laden would be killed May 2, 2011, in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, not far from Islamabad. Thegatewaypundit.com reports: “Our tribal contacts came to us and said, ‘Look, he’s in this location now. When he leaves, he’s going to have to go through this particular crossroads.’ And so what they proposed was to bury a huge cache of explosives underneath those crossroads so that when his convoy came through they could simply blow it up. And we said absolutely not. We were risking jail if we didn’t tell them that,” he said. At the time, Clinton, the State Department, and other officials did not view bin Laden as a serious threat, the documentary’s director Greg Barker told The Beast. In fact, top Clinton officials “ignored and even ridiculed” anyone who said bin Laden was a danger. Marty Martin, a CIA counterterrorism officer at the time, said in the documentary that “the threat was real.” “And if President Clinton had taken action and killed Osama bin Laden, there wouldn’t have been a 9/11, and if there wouldn’t have been a 9/11 there wouldn’t have been an Afghanistan, and if there wouldn’t have been an Afghanistan there wouldn’t have been an Iraq. What would the world be like?” he said. Clinton has discussed why he never took out bin Laden, saying he feared collateral damage in the form of civilian deaths. But the documentary Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said during a February 2016 debate that Clinton actually missed numerous opportunities to kill the terrorist. “The responsibility of 9/11 falls on the fact that al Qaeda was allowed to grow and prosper and the decision was not made to take out their leader when the chance existed to do so. Not once but four times according to the 9/11 report. President Clinton has acknowledged that as a regret,” he said. “The day before the Sept. 11 attacks,” The Washington Post reported in 2016, “Clinton told businessmen in Australia that he had decided against launching a strike in Kandahar out of concern for civilian casualties: ‘I nearly got him. And I could have killed him, but I would have to destroy a little town called Kandahar in Afghanistan and kill 300 innocent women and children, and then I would have been no better than him. And so I didn’t do it.’” Petition Demanding Resignation of ‘Incompetent’ W.H.O. Chief Set to Top 1 Million Signatures Joe Biden: I’d Pick Michelle Obama as VP ‘in a Heartbeat’

Petition Demanding Resignation of ‘Incompetent’ W.H.O. Chief Set to Top 1 Million Signatures,"A petition urgently demanding the resignation of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stands poised to break the one million signatures mark, just days after Hollywood celebrities praised him as a “superstar” during the Global Citizen concert. The campaign began on January 31 when the petition titled, “Call for the resignation of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, W.H.O. Director-General,” appeared on Change.org, citing Tedros’ refusal on January 23 to designate the coronavirus a global health emergency. “We strongly think Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is not fit for his role as WHO director general. We call for the immediate resignation of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,” the petition states, before accusing Ghebreyesus of being a political puppet for China.  “We believe WHO is supposed to be political neutral. Without any investigation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus solely believes in the death and infected numbers that the Chinese government provided with them.” On Tuesday morning the number of signatures stood at 985, 850 — and was rising fast. The petition can be signed here. Breitbart reports: The criticism of the handling of the Chinese coronavirus crisis by W.H.O. in general and Tedros in particular has been growing for weeks. Such is the clamor of disapproval surrounding the Ethiopian bureaucrat that last week U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a hold on funds sent to the U.N. body, demanding they answer for their failures to properly warn the world about the deadly virus. The president also criticized the W.H.O. for attacking his travel ban on China during the early days of the pandemic.

Tom Hanks Plays a Toy Xylophone While Demanding Mail-in Voting in Presidential  Election,"Former first lady Michelle Obama teamed up with Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson on Monday to push for mail-in voting across America in the November presidential election.  “I want to vote no matter where I am,” said Hanks, who played a toy xylophone and appeared in a giddy mood. “I have Diabetes type 2 and I still want to be able to vote.“ “Now we have railroads and copper wires and telephones, we have technology at our disposal now that can help us guarantee that every single American practices their constitutional right to vote,” shouted Hanks. Appearing in a “virtual voter registration drive” on Monday, Obama and Hanks, who was playing a toy xylophone, endorsed the Democrats’ controversial plan to roll out mail-in voting in time for the presidential election. Organizers of the event had the audacity to describe it as a “non-partisan effort”, even though it was dominated by former Obama administration faces, including former special White House advisor Valerie Jarrett, and Hollywood celebrities. Breitbart report: Michelle Obama was the marquee speaker at the virtual “couch party” organized by When We All Vote, a voter registration group that bills itself as non-partisan but is stacked with former Obama administration officials.  In addition to Jarrett, its leaders include Tina Tchen, who served as Michelle Obama’s chief of staff, and Kyle Lierman, who served as a policy advisor in the White House Office of Public Engagement. “Voting should never be difficult and never be a partisan issue,” Michelle Obama told viewers via phone Monday evening during the online drive. The former first lady  spoke about the recent Wisconsin primaries, which took place in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and how the organization’s members need to push vote-by-mail for the elections in November. “I don’t think you need me to tell you that this work is more urgent than ever before,” she said. Voting by mail has become a hotly contested issue in the lead-up to the presidential election. Democrats have introduced a measure in Congress to increase vote-by-mail options throughout the country. But President Donald Trump has stated that he is against it because it increases the likelihood of voter fraud. Valerie Jarrett told viewers that “voting transcends politics” while speaking via video from her apartment in New York. “Everyone should be able to vote by mail,” she said. The former Obama advisor appeared on MSNBC last week to push the initiative, saying that  the federal government should make it “as easy as possible” for people to vote. Jarrett also said Monday that online voter registration should be universal. “Every single American should be able to register to vote online,” she said. Co-chairs Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson appeared remotely from Los Angeles, to liven up the virtual party with star power.“I want to vote no matter where I am,” said Hanks, who played a toy xylophone and appeared in a giddy mood. “I have Diabetes type 2 and I still want to be able to vote.” Wilson called vote by mail a “great compromise” and said that “we as Americans should be able to request the options” of a mail-in ballot. The virtual couch party also featured an appearance by Vanita Gupta, who heads the The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Gupta worked as an attorney at the Justice Department during the Obama administration. “In light of COVID-19, states need to loosen their requirements,” she said. “It should be easy and accessible for everyone.” Nasty Nancy Gets Destroyed For Saying ‘Every Life Is Precious’… While Supporting Abortion Petition Demanding Resignation of ‘Incompetent’ W.H.O. Chief Set to Top 1 Million Signatures 
			 "
Nasty Nancy Gets Destroyed For Saying ‘Every Life Is Precious’… While Supporting Abortion,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized President Donald Trump’s plans to re-open America, claiming it’s still too dangerous and chiding the president with the line “Every life is precious.” Unfortunately for Nasty Nancy, this comment didn’t go unnoticed by Americans and she got slammed in ways she never saw coming.  As many people pointed out, Pelosi stating “every life is precious” is really rich considering she won Planned Parenthood’s 2014 Margaret Sanger Award. This has been a week from hell for Nancy Pelosi who has made three huge mistakes that is causing her a lot of grief from the American people. MadWorld report: Nancy Pelosi abandoned her post as House Speaker last week by instituting a “full pay” leave for herself and her cohorts until May 4. Then, she flew her family from New York to her San Francisco mansion which we bet doesn’t come under “essential travel.” Americans were rightly livid, but she was just getting warmed up.  The Speaker was caught making a cringe-worthy appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden where she dazzled the country showing off her two $24,000 dollar industrial-sized refrigerators full of $13 dollar a pint ice cream. On Tuesday, Pelosi blamed the president for causing “unnecessary deaths and economic disaster” and ultimately bungling the “strong economy” supposedly handed to him in 2017, Breitbart reports.  Pelosi also claimed she was in “prayer and reflection” when we all know the truth is she was busy eating a ton of chocolate ice cream.  The 80-year-old Democrat is still refusing to work with the GOP to aid the small businesses which are running out of money. “I cannot understand after watching another 5 million get unemployed how Speaker Pelosi continues to say no,” GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a press call with reporters, Fox News reported. Making matters worse, Pelosi is now complaining about President Donald Trump’s plan to reopen America for business. Nancy said Trump’s “in denial” and called his push to swiftly reopen the country “really scary.” She then posted this tweet: “To say ‘People will die, so be it’ instead of a science & testing-based path to reopening the economy is deeply frivolous & wrong. Every life is precious. Each death is heartbreaking — for a family & for a community. This is something we are all in together. #FamiliesFirst.”  Well, that’s really rich coming from the woman who won Planned Parenthood’s 2014 Margaret Sanger Award. “A person dies every time an abortion is committed and you simply say ‘so be it.’ Indeed, every life is precious. Start acting like it,” tweeted Abby Johnson, the former Planned Parenthood clinic director turned anti-abortion activist. A person dies every time an abortion is committed and you simply say “so be it.” Indeed, every life is precious. Start acting like it. “The Hypocrisy is strong with this one, Nancy, but nice try. You’re for intentionally killing innocent and vulnerable preborn children. Your ‘every life is precious’ line falls like sand from your lips. Until your actions align with your words, you’ll forever be a hypocrite,” tweeted Mattea Merta. The Hypocrisy is strong with this one, Nancy, but nice try. You're for intentionally killing innocent and vulnerable preborn children. Your ""every life is precious"" line falls like sand from your lips. Until your actions align with your words, you'll forever be a hypocrite. https://t.co/oXJlKD2OAL “Dear Nancy, If you believed every life was precious, you’d be pro-life,” tweeted Seth Dillion. Dear Nancy,If you believed every life was precious, you'd be pro-life. https://t.co/wQQDyVrlGD Another Twitter user added a response:  “Pelosi: Remember that speech @realDonaldTrump gave at the State of the Union warning us about the #coronavirus ….[‘I tore it up, said Pelosi]’” tweeted “AJ.”  Pelosi: Remember that speech @realDonaldTrump gave at the State of the Union warning us about the #coronavirus ….#AmericaFirst #PPPLOANS#PaycheckProtectionProgram pic.twitter.com/Cgx3OaRkKW Every American should see the writing on the wall. The Democrats would rather see America collapse economically than see the president succeed. They’d rather see the 22 million currently unemployed be joined by millions more. They’d rather see deaths by suicide, depression, and families ruined for generations than see Trump rally the country and salvage as many American jobs as he can. Experts economists are sending the dire warning that America needs to reopen for business as soon as possible.  President Trump is working on this crisis 24/7 while Pelosi stuffs her face with expensive ice cream. We trust the man in the White House who is actually doing something, not the woman in San Francisco who is spending her time showing off her lavish kitchen appliances to suffering Americans. Trump Derangement Syndrome: 60% of Dems Say China is Blameless, Trump To Blame For Crisis Tom Hanks Plays a Toy Xylophone While Demanding Mail-in Voting in Presidential  Election 
			 "
"Trump Derangement Syndrome: 60% of Dems Say China is Blameless, Trump To Blame For Crisis","There is partisanship, there is hyper partisanship, then there is full-blown Trump Derangement Syndrome. According to a new Rasmussen poll, a staggering 60% of Democrats actually believe President Trump is to blame for the coronavirus crisis — not “anything that China did.“ Rasmussen asked people if they agreed with Dem Sen. Chris Murphy when he said a few days ago, “The reason that we’re in the crisis that we are today is not because of anything that China did, is not because of anything the WHO did. It’s because of what this president did.”  Sen. Murphy wasn’t just maximizing Trump’s blame, he was minimizing China’s. Which a lot of Democrats like, it seems. The latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 42% of all Likely U.S. Voters agree with U.S. Senator Chris Murphy’s recent statement: “The reason that we’re in the crisis that we are today is not because of anything that China did, is not because of anything the [World Health Organization] did. It’s because of what [President Trump] did.” Forty-seven percent (47%) disagree with the Connecticut Democrat. Eleven percent (11%) are undecided. (To see survey question wording, click here.) Once again, though, there’s a clear partisan difference of opinion. Sixty percent (60%) of Democrats agree with Murphy that Trump is more to blame than China and the WHO. Seventy-one percent (71%) of Republicans and unaffiliated voters by a 46% to 39% margin disagree… Thirty-two percent (32%) of all voters think the U.S. government’s response to the coronavirus has been better than government actions in most other countries. Forty-two percent (42%) say it’s worse than others, while 24% view it as about the same. This plague is Chinese communism’s curse on the world and I resent any effort by liberals blinded by their hatred of Trump to minimize the cold, hard facts of the matter.  Here’s Dan Crenshaw making the case that Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus pandemic. He may be slightly overstating his case, but earning the president’s favor is a smart moves for an ambitious young conservative. You are being bombarded with the left’s hyperbolic and hypocritical attacks about the Trump Administration’s response to coronavirus. It’s disingenuous and counterproductive, so it’s time to debunk this false narrative with facts.WATCH 1/3 pic.twitter.com/RfoVghtvK6 2/3 pic.twitter.com/HXxEI80HCO 3/3 pic.twitter.com/oqPh7slqkj ‘Pedophile Hunters’ Catch Police Chief Trying to Have Sex with 14-Yr-Old Boy Nasty Nancy Gets Destroyed For Saying ‘Every Life Is Precious’… While Supporting Abortion 
			 "
‘Pedophile Hunters’ Catch Police Chief Trying to Have Sex with 14-Yr-Old Boy,"A police chief in Stow, Massachusetts has been relieved of his duties as the city’s top cop and is facing an investigation after a video by a self-declared “pedophile hunter” was posted online.  The video shows Stow Police Chief Ralph Marino allegedly attempting to meet a boy — who he knew was only 14 — for sex. Instead of meeting the boy, however, the chief was confronted by the pedophile hunters from Predator Poachers Massachusetts. Below is the disturbing video of the police chief attempting to groom a child and lure him into meeting for sex. Had the boy been an actual real child, there is no telling what the chief might have done. Warning, the text messages in the video below are disturbing. TFTP report: As NBC10 Boston reports, Marino met with Massachusetts State Police representatives Saturday at the Stow police department. After the meeting he put himself on indefinite administrative leave. In a statement, the town said it would cooperate fully in “any investigation of Chief Marino or any other matters. “There is no reason to believe that the activities being investigated involve or concern the operations of the Stow Police Department,” the statement said. As the video shows, the ‘Catch a Predator’ style format of the group found the chief waiting outside of a local establishment. The chief had allegedly been exchanging text messages with the undercover vigilantes in the Predator Poachers group, who he thought was a 14-year-old boy. The chief’s messages were gruesome in nature and illustrated his level of depravity. The chief knew that the person he was communicating with was a child.  Despite the fact that he knew the person on the other end of the text was a child, the chief described his sexual desires to him, asked the child about the size of his genitals, and arranged to meet the child in a place “out of the way.” The video starts when the chief is waiting to meet the boy, ‘somewhere out of the way.’ In the video, the man confronts Marino and attempts to identify him as ‘Mark.”  Marino looks shocked and the man filming accuses the chief of trying to meet a 14-year-old boy for sex. Predator Poachers knew that Marino was their man, as he had asked the chief to send a picture of himself to the 14-year-old boy, and the chief complied. The chief appears to be frantically scrolling through his phone in an apparent attempt to delete the conversation with the pretend boy. However, as he reportedly attempts to delete the texts, the man filming tells him that he has them all in screen shots already. The chief then walks away and gets into what appears to be a police-issued vehicle before driving off in shame. The entire time, the man filming is calling him out in front of everyone. It is important to note that the folks at Predator Poachers didn’t immediately identify the man in their video as the police chief. However, after the chief appeared on local news when a 2-year-old girl went missing, they pegged him. About 25 minutes before the chief went on the air to announce that a 2-year-old girl had gone missing, the chief was trying to lure a child for sex. As TB Daily News points out: The messages continue on April 13 at 10:05 AM, when the Chief attempts to bring the child into the woods, presumably for sex. This is significant because according to WCVB a two year old girl in Stow went missing at 10:30 AM, and was found at 12:30 PM. These vigilantes out their catching alleged pedophiles provides an a much-needed service to humanity. There are groups like this all over the country and through their actions, they serve to deter pedophiles going online for fear of being outed. Sadly, however, despite the high chances of the person on the other end of the text message being a cop or predator hunter, these sickos are unable to control their urges and continue to get busted.  This is overtly apparent in the alleged actions of this police chief. He is a cop. He knows what happens to pedophiles in jail, knows that there are stings all the time to take them down, yet he still actively sought out sex with a child online. Shameful indeed. AOC Celebrates Oil Price Crash: ‘You Absolutely LOVE to See It’ Trump Derangement Syndrome: 60% of Dems Say China is Blameless, Trump To Blame For Crisis 
			 "
AOC Celebrates Oil Price Crash: ‘You Absolutely LOVE to See It’,"Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY) on Monday deleted a tweet in which she celebrated the oil crash, which is likely to lead to massive loss of jobs in America.  A futures contract for US crude dropped a whopping 100% on Monday as demand for oil dipped to an all-time-low amid the coronavirus pandemic. Ocasio-Cortez immediately took to social media to celebrate the news, stating, “You absolutely love to see it.” “This along with record low interest rates means it’s the right time for a worker-led, mass investment in green infrastructure to save our planet.” She ended her tweet with “*cough*,” implying that the devastating price crash vindicated her previous environmental activism.  Shortly after publishing the tweet, a panic-stricken AOC deleted the post after getting called out for celebrating American job losses while calling for a Communist revolution. She replaced the tweet with a more somber one, arguing it was a “snapshot” of a “turning point” for the climate change movement. “Fossil fuels are in long-term structural decline. This along w/ low interest rates means it‘s the right time to create millions of jobs transitioning to renewable and clean energy,” AOC wrote. “A key opportunity.” This snapshot is being acknowledged as a turning point in the climate movement.Fossil fuels are in long-term structural decline.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who loves to remind people she has an econ degree, explain contango and oil contracts to the rest of us who don’t see the logic in what she’s suggesting,” asked RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway. yeah, no. you don't get to memory hole that one, @AOC. pic.twitter.com/vk6ywnhIpP .@AOC deleted this tweet cheering on U.S. workers losing their jobs. pic.twitter.com/xVZNSSV2fo Why did you delete this? pic.twitter.com/JpO1CZ6Uq9 After deleting that tweet, I would love to see Rep.

Oil futures plunged below zero on Monday, the latest never-before-seen number to come out of the economic coma caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Stocks and Treasury yields also dropped on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 down 1.8%, but the market’s most dramatic action by far was in oil, where the cost to have a barrel of U.S. crude delivered in May plummeted to negative $37.63. It was at roughly $60 at the start of the year. Traders are still paying $20.43 for a barrel of U.S. oil to be delivered in June, which analysts consider to be closer to the “true” price of oil. Crude to be delivered next month, meanwhile, is running up against a stark problem: traders are running out of places to keep it, with storage tanks close to full amid a collapse in demand as factories, automobiles and airplanes sit idled around the world. Tanks at a key energy hub in Oklahoma could hit their limits within three weeks, according to Chris Midgley, head of analytics at S&P Global Platts. Because of that, traders are willing to pay others to take that oil for delivery in May off their hands, so long as they also take the burden of figuring out where to keep it.

Ayanna Pressley: Trump’s Handling of Coronavirus ‘Akin to WAR CRIMES’,"Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley delcared on Monday that President Trump’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak is “akin to war crimes.” Pressley and other far-left members of the House held a virtual press conference on Facebook to criticize the Trump administration and put fourth their demands for what should be in the next coronavirus stimulus package.  “So as far as I’m concerned what’s happening with this administration, it’s akin to war crimes,” Pressley declared. “Criminal negligence, science denial, a sluggish response.” “And so we find ourselves in the position of playing catch up in the midst of a pandemic,” Pressley continued. “Which is the last place you want to be in the midst of any public health crisis — certainly not a pandemic — is working from behind.” “And we just have to reject any calls for a return to normal because that normal was what was slowly killing people,” Pressley said. The event was promoted as a “#PutPeopleFirst campaign” to stream-roll “progressive” priorities into future legislation. Breitbart.com reports: Past relief bills, and the present negotiations over additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), have focused on the American economy, which has been largely shut down for fear of the coronavirus spreading. The demands by left-wing members of Congress include a guaranteed income for individuals and families for an extended period of time; universal health care; debt forgiveness; and housing guarantees. Those on the call included Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), Mark Pocan (D-WI), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA). Activists included Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of the Indivisible Project; Lorella Praeli, president of Community Change Action; Greisa Martinez Rosas, DACA recipient and deputy executive of United We Dream; and Reggie Hubbard, a Washington, DC-based strategist with MoveOn.org.

The 2018 photo shows Whitmer smiling gleefully into the camera, whilst wearing a pink hat that says “Planned Parenthood makes America great.” The photograph comes from a tweet made by the Michigan Gov. She captioned her selfie saying, “The future is bright…. and pink!” Last week, Whitmer drew widespread criticism when she declared that abortion was “life sustaining” during the COVID-19 outbreak: “A woman’s healthcare, her whole future, her ability to decide if and when she starts a family is not an election, it is a fundamental to her life,” Whitmer claimed. “It is life sustaining and it’s something that government should not be getting in the middle of. ” Thegatewaypundit.com reports: Whitmer has drawn huge protests for overstepping her authority during the pandemic by imposing despotic restrictions on the people of Michigan, including banning the purchase of seeds, American flags, and other items.  She has also prohibited the use of motor boats and vacation homes – all while keeping abortion facilities open and operating.

It has already been shown that self-quarantining, whatever you want to call it, besides distancing and PPE’s, has been working. It works.” “I was looking up Sweden, one of my favorite countries, well they really screwed up. They have had this policy where everyone can go out and do what they have to do and use your own judgment don’t gather in groups more than fifty people, which is a lot of people, by the way. They have closed the schools, yes they have, but people are going to restaurants. Now they have 17 times the rate of their fellow Scandinavian countries, Norway, Finland, etc. So it has not worked. It doesn’t work. Stay home,” she continued. “These people are being egged on by right-wing media and people like Alex Jones, like Rush Limbaugh.

			 "
Gates Foundation Is World Health Organization’s Second Largest Donor,"Over the past decade, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has become the World Health Organization’s second largest donor. They may now have moved up to take their place as the agency’s largest donor. Until just last week, when President Trump halted US funding to the WHO, the only donations higher than those from the Gates Foundation came from the US government. Dr Rath Foundation reports: Providing proof that the independence of the World Health Organization (WHO) has been severely compromised, a document from the 2018 annual meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the WHO’s decision-making body, gives revealing details of where the organization’s funding comes from. During 2017, the total amount of money provided to the WHO by countries was exceeded by that coming from non-state actors, including the pharmaceutical industry. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation contributed almost $327 million to the WHO’s General and Fiduciary Funds, making it the second-largest donor overall. The only donations to these funds higher than those of the Gates Foundation came from the government of the United States. Money donated by countries to the WHO’s General and Fiduciary Funds totaled $1.06 billion in 2017. This was less than the contributions from non-state actors, which amounted to $1.08 billion. Along with the Gates Foundation, other prominent sources of funding included the Brussels EU Commission, which gave over $84 million; the ‘Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria’, an organization promoting the use of antiretroviral drugs and other pharmaceutical approaches, which contributed over $16 million; and UNITAID, another organization promoting the use of pharmaceuticals, which gave almost $30 million. Drug and chemical industry donations to the WHO The multinational drug and chemical industries and their investors figure prominently in the lists of WHO donors. Money contributed to the WHO’s General Fund by these sources during 2017 included the following: Other prominent WHO donors during 2017 included banks, private foundations with links to the pharmaceutical industry, and the George SorosOpen Society Institute. Gates treated like a head of state by the WHO With the contributions provided to the WHO by the Gates Foundation now exceeding those of every national government on earth apart from the United States, the WHO clearly no longer has any independence in the field of health. Having traded its scientific credibility for funding from business interests, its advice on the prevention and control of diseases cannot be trusted. The money donated by Gates undoubtedly buys him a lot of attention at the WHO. Illustrating the extent to which he has essentially ‘captured’ the organization, the picture at the top of this article shows him sitting alongside Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General between 2007 and 2017, at a press conference in Geneva. The sway Gates gained over the WHO during Chan’s tenure has led to him being labeled by some as “the world’s most powerful doctor”. As Politico has pointed out, the size of his contributions have brought him an outsized influence on the WHO’s agenda. The first private individual to give a keynote speech at a WHA meeting, Gates’ authority at the WHO is said to be comparable to that of a head of state. In this situation, it isn’t difficult to imagine that, should Gates ever threaten to withdraw his gigantic funding, the WHO would inevitably bend its policies to suit his will. Indeed, it is said that the appointment in 2017 of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as the new Director-General of the WHO was made with Gates’ support. Clearly, having sold its soul to Gates and other business donors, the WHO no longer represents the interests of patients. The time has therefore come for it to be replaced with a new global body tasked with the goal of making natural preventive health a human right. Achieving this will require the creation of an organization that is truly independent. Avoiding the mistakes of the WHO and its leaders will be essential for such a body to succeed.

In another outburst, Moore exclaimed that Trump was dangerously making the coronavirus a “partisan” issue. Then, only last week, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director devoted the last segment of his podcast, Rumble with Michael Moore, to an attack against white men. “Men — especially white men have a big responsibility to make amends for the Trump era,” Moore said on Thursday. “Those amends will happen.

MSN reports:  Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he was suspending the  funding  for a period of weeks, pending a review of the WHO’s role  in what he  phrased as “severely mismanaging and covering up the  spread of the  coronavirus.”    He accused the organization of allowing China to cover up the  true extent of the coronavirus,   which has now infected more than 600,000 and killed more than  26,000 Americans. The virus is now close to infecting   2 million people worldwide.   
  Democratic representatives have also criticized the move, while  WHO

Djokovic, 32, was speaking in a Facebook live chat on Sunday, and suggested he may to choose to retire from the sport rather than submit to the pressure to receive a vaccination.  “Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,” said Djokovic, a three time US Open champion.  “But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don’t know. “Hypothetically, if the season was to resume in July, August or September, though unlikely, I understand that a vaccine will become a requirement straight after we are out of strict quarantine and there is no vaccine yet.” Arguably the greatest athlete in world tennis, renowned for his stamina and strength, Djokovic became world number 1 in 2011 and has stayed there ever since, apart from a spell in the second half of last year when Roger Federer relegated him to No 2. Djokovic remains on course to become the most successful male tennis player in history. With 17 Grand Slam titles under his belt, the Serbian is only three titles away from the longstanding record held by Australian Rod Laver. The decision to stand down from the game at this point in his career, with historic milestones looming, would reverberate around the world.  Last month, former women’s world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo tweeted that “no vaccine = no tennis.” Neither the ATP nor WTA tours have said that a vaccination will be necessary for players to resume playing on the tour, while scientists state a Covid-19 vaccine may be 12 months or more away. Bill Gates Still Pouring MILLIONS Into ‘Remote Control’ Contraceptive Human Microchip As Trump Defunds The Agency, Lady Gaga Calls WHO Chief A True ‘Superstar’ 
			 "
Bill Gates Still Pouring MILLIONS Into ‘Remote Control’ Contraceptive Human Microchip,"Bill Gates is funding the development of a contraceptive microchip that will control women’s fertility wirelessly, via remote control. While the idea may be reminiscent of something out of a disturbing sci-fi movie, the technology is currently in development, with Bill Gates pouring millions of dollars into the project. If Gates has his way, the day when women are implanted with the hormone-emitting human microchip is not far away. It’s been six years now since the Microsoft founder, a vocal proponent of population control, announced plans for the development of a human microchip designed to control women’s fertility.  Research and development into the technology remains in progress, with Microchips Biotech listing the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as donors on the front page of their website: “With the support of the The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in the form of approximately $17.9 million in grant funding to date, and the potential for up to an additional $2.5 million in grant funding in 2020, Microchips has been developing an implantable long-acting, reversible contraceptive application of the technology.“ Townhall report: Measuring just 20 mm x 20 mm x 7mm, the tiny chip would be implanted under the skin, and automatically deliver a daily 30 microgram dose of the hormone levonorgestrol, via controlled release. If a woman decides at some point that she would like to conceive a child, she is said to be able to deactivate the device with a remote control. The microchip is designed to prevent pregnancy for up to 16 years. People familiar with the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will not be surprised to learn that the wirelessly-controlled contraception device was purportedly Bill Gates’ idea.  During Gates’ 2014 visit to an MIT laboratory, Bill asked if the microchip originally designed in the 1990s to deliver drugs to osteoperosis patients might also be developed into a long-term birth control plan. The company Microchips stepped up to the plate. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has a long history of advocating for population control, particularly in developing countries. According to the foundation’s website, it is apparently a problem that “less than 20% of women in Sub-Saharan Africa use modern contraceptives”. They go on to list the purported benefits of sterilizing large swathes of African women–which apparently include, for every dollar spent on family planning, saving “governments up to 6 dollars that can be spent on improving health, housing, water, sanitation, and other public services.” Bill and Melinda Gates “are particularly committed to exploring how our family planning efforts can meet the needs of young women and girls.” Presumably, the birth control microchip is still being tested. Though where, and by whom, remains largely a mystery. The question is troubling, especially considering the Gates’ ongoing interest in vulnerable, impoverished nations. It is also yet unknown how the device is performing, and how much longer before it gains FDA-approval and becomes available to women in America.  Hillary Clinton’s Attorneys Claim Tulsi Gabbard Must Be a ‘Russian Asset’ Because She’s ‘Anti-War’ World No. 1 Djokovic May Retire From Tennis Before Submitting To ‘Forced’ Covid-19 Vaccine

Hillary Clinton’s Attorneys Claim Tulsi Gabbard Must Be a ‘Russian Asset’ Because She’s ‘Anti-War’,"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard must be a “Russian asset” because she is anti-war and anti-regime change, according to the twisted logic of Hillary Clinton’s lawyers. Clinton’s lawyers filed a motion to dismiss Tulsi Gabbard’s $50 million defamation lawsuit filed by the Hawaii Congresswoman last year, citing anti-regime change and anti-war tweets and assorted smear articles as evidence of Clinton’s “Russian Asset” claim. BREAKINGTulsi Gabbard v Hillary Clinton Lawsuit Update:04/13: Clinton's attys. file motion to dismiss and double down on the ""Russian Asset"" smear—using Gabbard's anti regime change war tweets and assorted smear articles—as evidence of Clinton's ""Russian Asset"" claim. pic.twitter.com/1gwk3uum87 The screenshots above are the actual evidence submitted Clinton’s attorneys. The strategy, it seems, is to double down on Hillary Clinton’s “Russian Asset” smears by attempting to prove to a jury that being anti-Syrian regime change makes Clinton’s claim not just not defamatory—but true. “No one is above the law. This lawsuit is about accountability – not just for me but for all service members and for the American people,” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, said on why she’s suing Hillary Clinton. The motion to dismiss the lawsuit is the latest attempt by Hillary Clinton to evade justice. Clinton or her representatives declined to accept the papers in three attempts to serve them, according to Brian Dunne, lead attorney representing Gabbard. “After the media picked up this story, Ms. Clinton’s lawyer changed course and agreed to accept service,” Dunne told Fox News in a statement.  “We would have preferred that Ms. Clinton just accept federal judicial process in the first instance, without having to be called out by the press, but in any event, Tulsi Gabbard’s lawsuit against her will now be moving forward.”  POTUS Urges Citizens to Defend 2nd Amendment: “It’s Under Siege!” Bill Gates Still Pouring MILLIONS Into ‘Remote Control’ Contraceptive Human Microchip

POTUS Urges Citizens to Defend 2nd Amendment: “It’s Under Siege!”,"President Trump has urged American citizens to defend their God-given Second Amendment rights amid increasing draconian lockdown measures imposed by lawmakers.  On Saturday, POTUS suggested the public should “save” their constitutional rights, declaring “it is under siege!” “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!” Trump tweeted. LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege! Later that day, during a White House press briefing, a reporter from the Wall Street Journal asked Trump if it was “right time” to bring up Virginian 2A rights issues, citing his earlier tweet. Partial transcript: WALL STREET JOURNAL REPORTER: On that point though because the tweeting about in the case of Virginia linking second amendment to some of these issues about lifting some of these restrictions in these states and not… a concern for the governors and civil unrest (INAUDIBLE)?  TRUMP: I think just for that question I think that’s an easy one. That’s not even politics. We are entitled to a second amendment and he’s trying to take the second amendment, meaning that state is trying to take the Democrats in the state, the Republicans are fighting it. They are trying to take that–that second amendment, right, but second amendment right away. To me that’s liberty, that’s when I say liberate Virginia I would say liberate Virginia when that kind of thing happens and where does it all stop? So I think it’s a very good analogy. Go ahead. QUESTION: Is this the right time to kind of bring in a second amendment issue? TRUMP: I think when they talk about taking your guns away and if you notice at the beginning of this pandemic there were more guns sold I think that at almost any time in history so it’s obviously a big issue and then you have them working and signing documents trying to take your–your Second Amendment away essentially. So I do think it is an appropriate time to bring it up. Go ahead. Go ahead, second.

"Michigan Gov: No, I Do NOT Regret Lockdown Policy –  Despite Protests","Democrat Michigan Govenor Gretchen Whitmer has doubled down on her lockdown order, despite widespread protests in her state.  Appearing on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” on Sunday, Gov. Whitmer said she has absolutely no regrets on any of her draconian restrictions, despite the protests.  Transcript of the interview: TODD: All right, let’s talk about the issue of reopening the economy. Governor Whitmer, I want to start with you. You, you saw those protests. So let me ask this, do you have any regrets on any of the restrictions that you have put into place? WHITMER: I don’t. And here’s why. You know, Michigan right now has the third highest number of death from COVID-19. And yet, we’re the tenth largest state. We have a disproportionate problem in the state of Michigan. And so, we could take the same kinds of actions other states have, but it doesn’t rise to the challenge we’re confronting. And that’s precisely why we have to take a more aggressive stand. It’s working. We are seeing the curve start to flatten. But as people come in from across the state and gather and congregate without masks, without standing six feet apart, without those important protections, it means that they might have gone back to these parts of our state and perhaps brought COVID-19 along with them. Our rural hospitals are not equipped to handle a big surge. And that’s why this — important steps that we’ve taken are just critical to continuing to flatten that curve. TODD: Governor Whitmer, I want to stay with you here a minute on this issue though. I’m just curious, what have you learned about people’s patience, I guess, and your citizenry’s patience? And are you contemplating figuring out how to balance that a little bit? How do you essentially open a steam valve a little bit so that you don’t — so that these protests don’t become distractions to the greater good? WHITMER: Yeah. Absolutely. You know, every executive order that I’ve taken weighs heavily on me. I know when we pull kids out of school, that means they’re not getting the education they need. And some of them aren’t going to get the meals that they’ve come to rely on. I know that when we shut down bars and make restaurants dine out only, there are businesses that may never open again. And a lot of people are going to get laid off. These stay home orders weigh incredibly heavy because I know there’s an economic cost. I know there’s a mental health cost. People are struggling with this isolation that we have, you know, on top of all of the other stressors. But the fact of the matter is we have to be really smart about how we proceed. I’m glad to see that the White House recommended opening in phases or waves or whatever terminology you want to use. The fact of the matter is, we can’t just turn back to what life was like before COVID-19. We have to be strategic. We have to be careful. We have to look at different sectors of our economy. How often do they interact with the public? How close are — they work together? Are they indoor or outdoor? Do they share tools and machinery? I mean, all of these are factors that have to go into a really thoughtful situation where we start to phase back in sectors of our economy. But I’m always — we’re doing this calculation every day and looking to when we can do that safely because the worst thing would be a second wave.

Hollywood Celebs Accused of ‘Commie Propaganda’ After Performing ‘One World’ Concert for W.H.O.,"Hollywood celebrities who performed at the “One World” benefit concert on behalf of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) have been accused of spreading Chinese propaganda to millions of Americans. The “One World” concert, led by the W.H.O., was broadcast across multiple television channels in the U.S. on Saturday, with the aim of raising money for the W.H.O.’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund. Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Beyonce, Oprah Winfrey, Jennifer Lopez, Elton John, and Lady Gaga all performed at the event, with Lady Gaga gushing that W.H.O. Director-General Tedros Adhanom is a “superstar.” Breitbart.com reports: The concert also attracted contributions from political figures such as former first ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush, as well as celebrity supporters of the cause including former soccer star David Beckham and Microsoft founder Bill Gates. However, many people were left unimpressed by the event, denouncing the organization’s handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and describing it as a form of globalist propaganda. “If I could give No stars I would,” one Amazon reviewer wrote. “WHO lied! People died!! Let’s not forgot this!!! While we’re home given up our freedom and most of us without jobs these CELEBRITIES ask us to help raise money for the WHO?! Forget it!” “Yes, we need useless celebrities preaching to us how this isn’t China’s fault and how we should just all live as one nation,” added another. Skeptics also lashed out on Twitter against W.H.O. chief Dr. Tedros Adhanom, a former official in Ethiopia’s Marxist Tigray People’s Liberation Front, who has been the subject of widespread criticism for his attempts to downplay China’s role in the outbreak. That one world together at home commie propaganda sponsored by the CCP WHO and this global citizen bull crap is on at least 20 different stations. You can take your commie propaganda and shove it.

He should apologise to the world, otherwise, atulekemu! The concert also took place after President Donald Trump pledged to withdraw funding from the W.H.O., citing its connections to China and fatal decision to oppose travel restrictions during the virus’s onset. “Today I’m instructing my administration to halt funding of the World Health Organization while a review is conducted to assess the World Health Organization’s role in severely mismanaging and covering up the spread of the coronavirus,” Trump said at a White House press conference Tuesday. “The WHO’s attack on travel restrictions put political correctness above life-saving measures,” he continued. “The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion. Fortunately, I was not convinced and suspended travel from China saving untold numbers of lives.” Ugly Bette: POTUS Has 30,000 Corpses on His Hands Michigan Gov: No, I Do NOT Regret Lockdown Policy –  Despite Protests

President Trump Vows to Investigate If Coronavirus Originated in Chinese Lab Rob Reiner: Trump ‘Will Lose in LANDSLIDE Because Americans Will Be Voting for Their Lives’ 
			 "
President Trump Vows to Investigate If Coronavirus Originated in Chinese Lab,"President Trump has vowed to investigate claims that the deadly COVID-19 leaked from a Chinese lab before causing a global pandemic.  The president confirmed during a Friday press briefing that his administration was looking into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. Asked about the accuracy of reports that COVID-19 started spreading first from a Wuhan lab and not from a Chinese wet market, Trump signaled the U.S. is taking the matter very seriously. “We’re looking at it. A lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense,” Trump told reporters. “… There is a lot of investigation going on and we’re going to find out,” Trump said of the origin of the coronavirus. Foxnews.com reports: Trump said the global pandemic could have been prevented had China taken action in the early days. “All I can say is wherever it came from — it came from China, in whatever form — 184 countries are suffering because of it. And it’s too bad, isn’t it? It could have been solved very easily when it was just starting.” Trump’s comments coincide with Fox News’ earlier reporting that the U.S. is conducting a full-scale investigation into whether the novel coronavirus, which went on to morph into a global pandemic that has brought the global economy to its knees, escaped from a lab in Wuhan, China. Intelligence operatives are said to be gathering information about the laboratory and the initial outbreak of the virus. Intelligence analysts are piecing together a timeline of what the government knew and “creating an accurate picture of what happened,” the sources said. Once that investigation is complete — something that is expected to happen in the near-term — the findings will be presented to the Trump administration. At that point, White House policymakers and Trump will use the findings to determine how to hold the country accountable for the pandemic. Fox News first reported on Wednesday that there is increasing confidence that the outbreak likely originated in a Wuhan lab, not as a bioweapon but as part of a Chinese effort to show that its efforts to identify and combat viruses are equal or greater than those of the U.S. U.S. officials and the intelligence community have confirmed to Fox News that they have taken the possibility of the coronavirus being man-made or engineered inside China as some sort of bioweapon off the table and have ruled it out at this point. Sources point to the structure of the virus, in saying the genome mapping specifically shows it was not genetically altered. The sources believe the initial transmission of the virus was a naturally occurring strain that was being studied there — and then went into the population in Wuhan. Sources say the investigation of open source and classified data points to the work in the lab of Dr. Shi Zhengli, who was working on antivirals and immunizations for coronavirus, specifically with bats. U.S. officials are 100 percent confident China went to great lengths to cover up after the virus was out, the sources said. Additionally, the sources believe that the World Health Organization — which the president paused funding to this week over its role in the crisis — was either complicit in the cover-up, or looked the other way. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday reiterated that the administration was eyeing the Wuhan Institute of Virology and accused the Chinese government of stonewalling scientists from finding out what happened. “We know that the first sightings of this occurred within miles of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  We know that this – the history of the facility, the first BSL-4 lab where there’s high-end virus research being conducted, took place at that site,” Pompeo said on the Hugh Hewitt Show. “We know that the Chinese Communist Party, when it began to evaluate what to do inside of Wuhan, considered whether the WIV was, in fact, the place where this came from. “And most importantly, we know they’ve not permitted the world’s scientists to go into that laboratory to evaluate what took place there, what’s happening there, what’s happening there even as we speak,” he said. Judicial Watch Subpoenas Google For Hillary Clinton’s Deleted ‘BleachBit’ Emails Brennan Viciously Attacks POTUS as Rumors Swirl of Imminent Spygate Indictments 
			 "
Judicial Watch Subpoenas Google For Hillary Clinton’s Deleted ‘BleachBit’ Emails,"Judicial Watch, the team of American lawyers hell-bent on getting at the truth, have served a subpoena to Google, demanding the tech giant produce all Hillary Clinton emails from a Google account believed to contain the former secretary of state’s emails.  Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said a D.C. federal court, tired of “gamesmanship” and the Clinton email cover up, authorized the Google subpoena to “follow a lead” on the Clinton emails. “A federal court, tired of the State and Justice Departments’ gamesmanship, authorized Judicial Watch’s subpoena to Google to follow a lead on the Clinton emails,” Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said.  “DOJ and State are AWOL and covering up for Hillary Clinton, so it is again up to Judicial Watch to do the basic investigative heavy lifting to get at the truth.” Judicial Watch report: Platte River Networks’ IT specialist Paul Combetta reportedly used the Google account to transfer Clinton’s emails from a laptop to a Platte River server, then used BleachBit to remove all traces of the emails from the laptop.  Judicial Watch’s subpoena seeks all Clinton emails from her time at State, January 21, 2009, to February 1, 2013. Google is requested to produce the emails by May 13. The Google subpoena comes in a Judicial Watch’s lawsuit that seeks records concerning “talking points or updates on the Benghazi attack” (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:14-cv-01242)). Judicial Watch famously uncovered in 2014 that the “talking points” that provided the basis for Susan Rice’s false statements were created by the Obama White House. This Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit led directly to the disclosure of the Clinton email system in 2015. During an August 2019 federal court hearing, U.S District Court Judge Royce Lamberth raised concerns about Clinton’s Gmail cache and ordered Judicial Watch to “shake this tree” on the issue. Judge Lamberth noted that Senator Grassley released: a report in which he had some very troubling information about a guy named Combetta who had been one of the contract employees on the Clinton emails, and he and the Senator who Chairs the Homeland Security Committee released in the Senate this report Friday, and the gist of it was that Combetta had said, I guess, that he had created a dummy email account with all of the Hillary Clinton emails in it in a different name, and the FBI had investigated that to see whether or not the Chinese had ever hacked into it. They have determined that the Chinese hadn’t, but that the FBI never told the State Department about that account and that the emails that were not given over to State could have been obtained from that account, but the FBI never told State about it. So it leaves out in the open whether there are these other emails that State could have obtained but nobody ever bothered to tell State about them. I don’t know the status of that and I’m sure you don’t either, but that did occur to me that would be a problem for me as to whether an adequate examination of that circumstance occurred and, assuming that Combetta deleted them, as he said he did before he took the Fifth, I guess, whether or not the server that they were on or the — or whoever maintained the server, whether they can be reconstructed from — by that … *** [J]ust last week, the Senate’s – Senate Finance and Homeland Security Committees released documents revealing that Clinton IT aide Paul Combetta copied all but four of the missing emails to a Gmail account that does not appear to have ever been reconstructed and searched. The court thinks Judicial Watch ought to shake this tree. On March 2, 2020, Judge Lamberth grantedJudicial Watch’s request to subpoena Google for relevant documents and records associated with Clinton’s emails during her tenure at the State Department. Judicial Watch seeks to subpoena Google for relevant documents and records associated with Secretary Clinton’s emails during her tenure at State.… The subpoena seeks to discover new emails, so it certainly relates to whether State conducted an adequate search. *** The Court is not confident that State currently possesses every Clinton email recovered by the FBI; even years after the FBI investigation, the slow trickle of new emails has yet to be explained. For this reason, the Court believes the subpoena would be worthwhile and may even uncover additional previously undisclosed emails. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS this request. Judicial Watch’s subpoena requests all Clinton emails and metadata, “sent or forwarded to or from or saved, stored, archive, or contained in the Gmail account associated with the following address: a. CarterHeavylndustries@gmail.com; or b. carterheavyindustries@gmail.com.” In December 2018, Judge Lamberth first ordered discovery into whether Secretary Clinton’s use of a private email server was intended to stymie FOIA; whether the State Department’s intent to settle this case in late 2014 and early 2015 amounted to bad faith; and whether the State Department has adequately searched for records responsive to Judicial Watch’s request. The court also authorized discovery into whether the Benghazi controversy motivated the cover-up of Clinton’s email. The court ruled that the Clinton email system was “one of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency.” In addition to the Google subpoena, Judicial Watch was granted discovery that includes testimony under oath by Clinton and her former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills regarding Clinton’s emails and Benghazi attack records. Recently, Judicial Watch and the State Department, which is represented by Justice Department lawyers, filed responses opposing Clinton’s and Mills’ Writ of Mandamus request to overturn the lower court order requiring their testimony. Shocking Photos From Wuhan Lab Show ‘Broken Seal’ on Unit Storing 1,500 Virus Strains President Trump Vows to Investigate If Coronavirus Originated in Chinese Lab

"Shocking Photos From Wuhan Lab Show ‘Broken Seal’ on Unit Storing 1,500 Virus Strains","Photos from inside the secretive Chinese laboratory at the center of mounting international suspicion about the origins of the covid-19 pandemic clearly show a “broken seal” on a unit holding 1,500 virus strains including the bat coronavirus which caused the pandemic. The photos will do nothing to dispel fears that the coronavirus pandemic was caused by a from inside Wuhan’s Institute of Virology which has been covered up by China’s communist government. The photos, first published by the state-owned China Daily newspaper in 2018, were republished on Twitter last month, before being removed. One comment attached read: ‘I have seen better seals on my refrigerator in my kitchen.’ DailyMail report: The Mail on Sunday revealed a fortnight ago that British government ministers now fear that the pandemic could have started as the result of a leak.  TRENDING: White House Petition To Investigate Bill Gates For ‘Crimes Against Humanity’ Gains a Quarter Million Signatures Last week, the newspaper also disclosed that the institute had undertaken coronavirus experiments on bats captured more than 1,000 miles away in Yunnan, funded by a $3.7 million grant from the US government.  Sequencing of the Covid-19 genome has traced it to the bats found only in those caves.  These revelations led to Donald Trump being quizzed at a press conference last week about the leak theory, to which the President replied: ‘We are doing a very thorough examination of this horrible situation.’  President Trump also pledged on Friday evening to scrap US funding for the Wuhan institute. Meanwhile, secretary of state Mike Pompeo has demanded that Beijing ‘come clean’ over whether the virus had leaked from the lab. He said: ‘There is still lots to learn.  ‘The US government is work-ing diligently to figure it out.’  He added that one of the best ways that China could find to co-operate would be to ‘let the world in and let the world’s scientists know exactly how this came to be, exactly how this virus began to spread’. Suspicions of a Chinese cover-up increased further after the Washington Post reported that US diplomats in Beijing had written cables about the Wuhan laboratory in 2018, warning the state Department that ‘the lab’s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new SARs-like pandemic’. US intelligence sources say that shortly after the coronavirus outbreak began, officials at the lab destroyed samples of the virus, erased early reports and sup-pressed academic papers – and then tried to pin the blame on Wuhan’s wet market, where wild animals are sold for consumption. RELATED: Robert F Kennedy Jr: How Did Bill Gates ‘Land the Job of Dictating World Health Policy With No Election?’ The sources believe that ‘Patient Zero’ was an intern at the lab, who spread the virus into the local population after infecting her boyfriend.  One source described it as ‘the costliest government cover-up of all time’.  After initially accepting the wet market theory, intelligence officials in the US, Britain and Canada are increasingly focusing on the Wuhan institute, not least because of the level of coincidence required for the bats in Yunnan to have infected animals in Wuhan, which then passed it on to humans. Following a video meeting of the G7 nations on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said: ‘There are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.’  The World Health Organisation, which faces allegations of complicity with Beijing over the pandemic, quickly accepted and propagated the wildlife market theory. Although British Government sources say that the evidence suggests that the virus was ‘zoonotic’ – originating from an animal – that is still compatible with the theory that it first passed to humans as a result of an accident by scientists studying it in a laboratory.  However, one political source said that there was ‘growing scientific curiosity’ over the symptoms of a marked loss of taste and smell in many victims of Covid-19.  ‘This might – only might – indicate a level of human interference,’ the source said. Beijing insists that the fact that the country’s primary virology institute is based in the city at the centre of the outbreak is just a coincidence, dismissing links to the laboratory as ‘baseless conspiracy theories’. California Mayor, Who Compared Trump to Hitler and His Supporters to KKK, Dead in Plane Crash Judicial Watch Subpoenas Google For Hillary Clinton’s Deleted ‘BleachBit’ Emails

"California Mayor, Who Compared Trump to Hitler and His Supporters to KKK, Dead in Plane Crash","Dr. Bill Kirby, who decided Monday to step down as mayor of Auburn, California after making social media posts comparing supporters of President Donald Trump to the Ku Klux Klan, was killed Saturday morning in a single-engine plane crash, officials confirmed. The mayor, who also compared President Trump to Adolf Hitler in a comment and suggested “the world would be a much better place” without him, was the pilot of the plane that crashed shortly after 11 a.m near the Auburn Municipal Airport.  A passenger in the plane suffered minor injuries and was transported to a hospital, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. SacBee report: A Facebook post from Sacramento political consultant Jeff Raimundo carried a statement from the Kirby family confirming he was the victim. Photos provided by the Sheriff’s Office show flames in a field with scattered shrapnel near the airport. Auburn’s vice mayor, Matt Spokely, shared the news with city staff in an email, saying “we are all very shocked and saddened by the news.” Kirby, 72, had been a licensed pilot since at least 2009, according to public records. The Auburn City Council website says Kirby worked with the Flying Doctors group that travels to rural villages to set up and run free medical clinics. He was a father of two grown children and had been an Auburn resident for 30 years. Kirby, a self-described moderate, had also previously run for Congress in the 2002 Republican primary and had served on the board of the Auburn Recreation District. Kirby gained notoriety last week following social media posts criticizing President Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and comparing the president’s supporters to KKK members. He told the Auburn Journal a week ago that his Facebook posts were made on a personal page and that “this has nothing to do with my job. I reposted it.” He added that he “absolutely” believes Trump is a racist. Kirby’s posts and statements created an outcry and calls for his recall. He announced during a City Council meeting Monday that he was stepping aside from his post as mayor and was expected to be succeeded by Councilman Daniel Berlant during this week’s council meeting. This is the fourth plane crash near the Auburn airport in less than a year. In January, a father and son were killed in a crash. Last May, two nonfatal crashes occurred near the airport. Placer sheriff’s Lt. Andrew Scott said the department’s Critical Accident Investigation team responded to the crash and would participate virtually with investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
